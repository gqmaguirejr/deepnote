The problem is high delays implying low utilization of allocated resources for small file transfers or due to packet losses. High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA)\\u2019s potential to solve the problem is studied. Since in HSDPA, High-Speed Downlink shared channel (HS-DSCH) is introduced as an alternative of DCH on downlink packet access, a model of HS-DSCH is built and simulations are performed in order to compare its TCP performance with DCH. The focus is on studying retransmission delay and Block Error Rate (BLER) targets. Some scheduling methods are also compared. The results indicate that HS-DSCH gives better TCP performance than a DCH, and that advanced scheduling methods gives similar result as round robin if there are packet losses. Moreover, a somewhat surprising result is found regarding fast retransmission and channel utilization for increasing BLER targets.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93068\", \"number-of-pages\": \"46\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-IMIT-LCN.

The third generation of mobile communication systems (3G) will be a significant step forward in the convergence of telecommunications and datacommunications industries. More specifically, the convergence of mobile technologies and the Internet allows compelling possibilities for future applications and solutions. However, most current mobile businesses and mobile application and solution providers are rather contributing to the process of convergence; many current ideas and solutions are based on the restrictions of existing mobile networks combined with Internet-based services. In the future, when mobile networks and the Internet have merged, it will no longer be possible to create revenue with these types of solutions.\\nOne concrete solution is the mobile middleware concept, bridging the mobile technologies and Internet world. This Master\\u2019s thesis studies the middleware concept for providing business applications in the light of 3G, making strategic recommendations to a provider of these kinds of services. A comprehensive discussion about the developments after 3G is introduced. Alternative solutions are presented and some strategic implications are introduced. The implications are motivated by an industry survey, carried out within this project. The topic of over-the-air data synchronization is discussed as an example for interim middleware. Mobile computing file system issues are seen as an interesting opportunity for business applications. The possibility of remote desktop screen access is studied, and measurements proving its feasability for hosted wireless application service provision are made. Emerging mobile Java technologies are discussed as an efficient platform for providing ubiquitous, device independent end-to-end solutions. As one of the recommended strategies, this thesis introduces the concept of hybrid thickness client applications as a feasible solution for migrating from current middleware solutions to an (uncertain) future of native, thick terminal applications, within a scope of two years. Based on this concept, a prototype for a 3G smartphone application was developed as an example. A set of possible strategic scenarios is presented and discussed. This thesis also discusses operator differentiation and business solutions in an all-IP based world.\\n3G networks and handset devices will introduce a large number of new applications and business opportunities, but such a change will also introduce new challenges and risks. The migration challenge is being illustrated in the case of Smartner, a mobile middleware solution provider focusing on business applications. As shown by this case, compared to current enabling solutions, a major shift in technologies is seen as needed, in order to maintain long-term success.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93278\", \"number-of-pages\": \"183\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": \"3G; mobile business; middleware; front-end; operator-hosted; strategy; convergence; migration; XML; hybrid thickness client application; SyncML; Wireless OS; UMTS; GPRS; EPOC; Symbian; value added services; operator differentiation; competitive advantage\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-13T15:26:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-13T11:03:18.430+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:55:28.075+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93278\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 183.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:515331\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2003]]}, \"title\": \"A comparative study of two different network basedIP Virtual Private Network solutions\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Holmlund\", \"given\": \"Erik\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Lopez\", \"given\": \"Edgar\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Skanova, Telia\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Network based (layer 3) IP VPNs is a growing service and Skanova has a solution today which has received a lot of customer attention. The service is called VPN Flex and offers the customers secure communication between their different offices while supporting different traffic classes with a guaranteed maximum delay, jitter, and packet loss. VPN Flex has been a success so far in terms of the number of customers that have signed up for it in the short time it has been on the market. VPN Flex is realized over an IP network on Skanova's ATM backbone.\\nMeanwhile Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) has attracted a lot of attention and is considered to have a lot of nice features; the most import being the ability to provide layer 2 and layer 3 IP VPNs. The MPLS solution for providing network based layer 3 IP VPNs is described in RFC 2547, also called BGP/MPLS VPNs. It has become the de-facto standard for providing network based layer 3 IP VPNs. Skanova's VPN Flex service is provided by a partly Nortel proprietary solution using IP tunneling instead of MPLS tunneling which is used in RFC 2547.\\nThe purpose of this paper is to evaluate which network (i.e. link layer technology; specifically a frame based or a cell based media) and which network based IP VPN solution is most suitable to provide a network based layer 3 IP VPN service that supports different traffic classes so that Skanova's customers can use this VPN service to send best effort traffic, mission critical applications, IP Telephony, and Video Conferencing services between their different offices using a single layer 3 VPN solution.\\nIn my evaluation I have looked at the technology behind the VPN solution, the ability to provide delay, jitter, and packet loss guarantees as well as what it costs to produce the service along with the security and expected reliability. The purpose of having a master\\u2019s thesis student looking at this problem is that I would be objective and not have any predetermined conclusions.\\nThe result of the study is that the two different network based VPN solutions are not different with regard to the service they provide for the customers. However, there are some differences that affect the operator deploying and running the service. RFC 2547 is a more flexible solution with less manual configuration and better support for Inter-AS VPNs. It is possible to realize an RFC 2547 solution in either an ATM network or an IP network and the services will be implemented in much the same way. Both solutions could use Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) signaling and EXP Inferred PHB Scheduling Class LSPs (ELSPs), realizing traffic classes using the MPLS EXP bits. Which network to base the solution on, is a matter of QoS support, costs, and security. The ATM network today has better QoS support (such as more transmission queues and efficient schedulers). However, at the link speeds used in today\\u2019s backbones the fixed size cell of ATM is not a reason to use the ATM network instead of a frame based IP network.\\nThe cost of using Packet Over Sonet (POS) and ATM is the same. However, using Ethernet the port cost is less than half of either POS or ATM, which favors using an IP network in the A comparative study of two different network based IP Virtual Private Network solutions future. The security of a network based layer 3 IP VPN is mostly in the hands of the operator configuring the service and the network. Thus with regard to security, I do not believe there is a difference when realizing the network based IP VPN service in a public or private IP network. However, a network based IP VPN realized in a public IP network might pose a sales problem because many customers are worried about the security and availability of such a network.\\nRFC 2547 and MPLS seem to be the way to go in the future, but my recommendation is to make the transition slowly thereby minimizing Capital Expenditures (CAPEX). This is especially true since the current network based IP VPN service has been so well received. Whether Skanova should introduce MPLS and RFC 2547 in the IP network or the ATM network is very much dependent on their future strategy. I believe that both the IP network and the ATM network can support a service such as VPN Flex. Also, the way that MPLS will be used with regard to the VPN Flex service is the same.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93177\", \"number-of-pages\": \"96\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-18T14:38:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-12T14:46:38.557+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:57:00.444+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93177\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 96.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:515365\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2002]]}, \"title\": \"A Comparative Study ofTwo Multicast Routing Algorithms\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Berggren\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Borg\", \"given\": \"Martin\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Johnsson\", \"given\": \"Martin\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Enea Data AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This Master Thesis examines several aspects of two different multicast forwarding algorithms. The scaling properties of the currently used algorithms were examined under different criteria, such as delay, traffic concentration, and size of the routing tables.\\nMany new Internet applications, such as videoconferencing, resource discovery, Internet radio and online games, depend on a network support for efficient point-to-multipoint communication. Sending identical data to a group of receivers using a series of unicast transmissions obviously has massive scaling problems. Multicasting provides an efficient and elegant solution that significantly reduces the total bandwidth demand as well as the load on both senders and intermediate routers.\\nIn this report we study two multicast routing algorithms, source based trees (SBT) and core based trees (CBT). SBT builds one delivery tree per source and group by flooding the initial packet through the entire network, and then removing the links that do not lead to group members (\\u201cpruning\\u201d). To be able to discover new members, flooding must occur periodically. CBT on the other hand, builds one delivery tree per group, shared by all sources. There is one core router per group and members must explicitly join the delivery tree by notifying the core. Off-tree sources must tunnel their traffic to the core for distribution along the tree.\\nSBT has two main drawbacks. Firstly, the maintenance of the delivery tree requires periodic flooding of the network. Furthermore, SBT routers must keep state that grows as the product of the number of sources and the number of groups. CBT solves both of these scaling problems, but the shared tree will often lead to sub-optimal paths and increased delay. The traffic may also be concentrated on fewer links than in SBT.\\nWe compared the characteristics of the SBT and CBT algorithms in different network topologies using a simulation program. Since existing network simulation tools were found to be poor when it came to multicasting, we decided to develop a new network generator and simulator tool with multicasting aspects in focus. We also developed a tool to visualize the networks generated by the simulator and monitor the traffic. The report presents many simulation results that illustrate the significance of different trade-offs between SBT and CBT. Performance characteristics such as delay, join latency, tree size, total traffic and traffic concentration are analysed and examined.\\nThe conclusion is that each protocol can be preferable in certain scenarios, depending on how important the different parameters are. CBT always performs better than SBT for single source applications if the core can be placed at the sender\\u2019s local router. However, this core placement is not necessarily optimal for CBT. The situation is more complex in groups with several sources. There is a trade-off between the scaling problems of SBT and the increased delay and traffic concentration of CBT.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93199\", \"number-of-pages\": \"112\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-18T14:25:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-12T15:40:08.016+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:56:41.686+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93199\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 112.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:510502\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2009]]}, \"title\": \"A Comparison of C++, C#, Java, and PHP in the context of e-learning\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Olsson\", \"given\": \"Mikael\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The first part of this master thesis presents an effective method for producing video tutorials.

Context-awareness means that the computer can adapt to the situation in which it is working. Context is a key issue in mobile computing, especially with handheld devices (such as PDAs and mobile phones), due to the fact that they can be used while on the move; hence the environment around them can change. The environment of a static device may also change and require the device to adapt. Applications and systems that exploit context by both sensing and reacting to their environment are called context-aware applications. Devices that are context-aware are able to perceive stimuli and react accordingly, with minimal interaction with the user.\\nProviding context-aware services to users of mobile devices via context-aware applications is becoming an important and significant factor in the market and is a developing industry. In this thesis we analyze and develop an application that exploits context to provide a service that improves the interaction between humans and a computer. The thesis begins with a study of what types of sensors are available to provide information about the device's context. This is followed by the design of an appropriate way of using the selected sensor (ecompass) to provide a means of adapting a service to the user's and device's context. The focus is every day activities of a student at a university - specifically finding the location of a meeting room for a seminar; however, similar scenarios exist for other types of users.\\nAfter determining that it was feasible to add a e-compass as a sensor to an existing personal digital assistant and to provide a map to the mobile user, the focus of the thesis shifted to an examination of the performance of the adaptation of the map as the user moved the device. Initially it required excessive time to render the map on the device, thus as the user moved the device the map was not updated quickly enough for the user to know their correct orientation with respect to the map. Therefore the thesis project examined how this performance could be improved sufficiently that the rendering would keep up with the change in orientation of the device. This investigation lead to a shift from server based rendering of the map as an image, followed by the transfer of the image to the device for display; to a sending a scalable vector graphics version of the map to the device for local rendering. While initially this was expected to be much faster than transferring an image for an actual map of the building where this work was taking place the local rendering was actually slower. This subsequently lead to server based pruning of the irrelevant details from the map, then a transfer of the relevant portion of the map to the device, followed by local rendering.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91111\", \"number-of-pages\": \"79\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"36\", \"keyword\": \"Context-awareness; magnetic field sensor; Scalable Vector Graphics\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-08T09:26:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-07T18:29:26.972+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:30:09.261+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91111\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 79.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1049974\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2016]]}, \"title\": \"A Coordination Framework for Deploying Hadoop MapReduce Jobs on Hadoop Cluster\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Raja\", \"given\": \"Anitha\", \"localId\": \"u1rf65db\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Lu\", \"given\": \"Yue\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Apache Hadoop is an open source framework that delivers reliable, scalable, and distributed computing. Hadoop services are provided for distributed data storage, data processing, data access, and security. MapReduce is the heart of the Hadoop framework and was designed to process vast amounts of data distributed over a large number of nodes. MapReduce has been used extensively to process structured and unstructured data in diverse fields such as e-commerce, web search, social networks, and scientific computation. Understanding the characteristics of Hadoop MapReduce workloads is the key to achieving improved configurations and refining system throughput. Thus far, MapReduce workload characterization in a large-scale production environment has not been well studied.In this thesis project, the focus is mainly on composing a Hadoop cluster (as an execution environment for data processing) to analyze two types of Hadoop MapReduce (MR) jobs via a proposed coordination framework. This coordination framework is referred to as a workload translator. The outcome of this work includes: (1) a parametric workload model for the target MR jobs, (2) a cluster specification to develop an improved cluster deployment strategy using the model and coordination framework, and (3) better scheduling and hence better performance of jobs (i.e. shorter job completion time). We implemented a prototype of our solution using Apache Tomcat on (OpenStack) Ubuntu Trusty Tahr, which uses RESTful APIs to (1) create a Hadoop cluster version 2.7.2 and (2) to scale up and scale down the number of workers in the cluster.The experimental results showed that with well tuned parameters, MR jobs can achieve a reduction in the job completion time and improved utilization of the hardware resources. The target audience for this thesis are developers. As future work, we suggest adding additional parameters to develop a more refined workload model for MR and similar jobs.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-196951\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xviii,41\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2016:172\", \"keyword\": \"Hadoop; Workload Characterization; Parametric Modeling; Coordination framework; OpenStack; Workload deployment; Hadoop; Arbetsbelastning Karakterisering; Parametrisk Utformning; Koordinations system; OpenStack; Arbetsbelastnings Utplacering\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2016-12-06T11:25:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2016-11-27T20:08:52.191+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-27T04:26:50.949+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-196951\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 59.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:843073\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2015]]}, \"title\": \"A Data Model Driven Approach to Managing Network Functions Virtualization : Aiding Network Operators in Provisioning and Configuring Network Functions\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"S\\u00e4llberg\", \"given\": \"Kristian\", \"localId\": \"u1pfo2q2\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Wikstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Claes\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Cisco, Inc.\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Bevemyr\", \"given\": \"Johan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Cisco, Inc.\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Wallin\", \"given\": \"Stefan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Cisco\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This master\\u2019s thesis explains why certain network services are difficult to provision and configure using IT automation and cloud orchestration software.

Moreover, the proposed solution enables network operators to change the configuration at runtime. The work can be seen as a step towards self managing and auto scaling networks.The proposed approach is compared to a well known cloud management system (OpenStack) in order to evaluate if the proposed approach decreases the amount of time needed for network operators to design network topologies and services containing VNFs. Data is collected through observations of network operators, interviews, and experiment.Analysis of this data shows that the proposed approach can decrease the amount of time required for network operators to design network topologies and services. This applies if the network operators are already acquainted with the data modeling language YANG. The amount of time required to provision VNFs so that they respond to connections can also be decreased using the proposed approach. The proposed approach does not offer as much functionality as OpenStack, as it is limited to VNF scenarios.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-171233\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xix,120\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2015:159\", \"keyword\": \"NFV; SDN; VNF; Virtualization; NFV; SDN; VNF; Virtualization\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-07-28T09:53:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-07-24T16:47:24.723+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T13:05:15.751+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-171233\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 139.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:683816\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2013]]}, \"title\": \"A Distributed Approach for Global Product Lifecycle Management\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Vargas-Orellana\", \"given\": \"Julio\", \"localId\": \"u1ir8l0h\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Laudenbach\", \"given\": \"Rolf\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Aras Corp AG\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) is a holistic approach for managing product information throughout its life cycle. It integrates different concepts that have emerged due to changes in the manufacturing process as a result of globalization, increased competition, demand for more innovative products, and other reasons. These changes have leaded to a shift from a model with a single-location for product development to a model in which a complex network of specialized companies collaborate.This global collaborative PLM implies that companies from different parts of the world work together and must share information; hence the underlying PLM system is required to facilitate data management throughout this collaborative process. In addition, it is also necessary to address the challenges due to the new model being a distributed activity, as today this PLM system is a specialized distributed system.Maintaining data consistency can be challenging because collaborators can use heterogeneous PLM systems together with their own databases. The later cannot be shared due to the risks of exposing their knowledge base and business processes. Another consideration in global collaboration is that data is transmitted to remote locations. As a result network latency can be large; this can cause problems particularly when large files are exchanged, such as may be the case for CAD design models.This thesis proposes a solution enabling a global PLM which addresses the challenges described above. The approach consists of connecting collaborators\\u2019 nodes in a network that is constructed by grouping them with respect to intra-site latency. Each group implements a coordination mechanism based on the election of a node which is subsequently in charge of coordinating data access. The groups communicate via a publish-subscribe communication pattern, publishing and subscribing to events related to the resources being shared. The integration of the solution is through a Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) implementing web services that can be consumed by a PLM system. A prototype has been implemented and its applicability is analysed by evaluating its functionality in a collaborative scenario based on the Aras Innovator PLM platform.The evaluation was made by simulating the solution proposed and comparing it with a centralized approach. The results particularly showed that the proposed solution could reduce the intra-latency compared to a centralized approach if the collaborators are organized in collaborative groups, that exchange most of the information inside the group rather than intergroup.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-139105\", \"number-of-pages\": \"ix,55\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:247\", \"keyword\": \"Product Lifecycle Management; distributed systems; cluster head; Product Lifecycle Management; distribuerade system; cluster head\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-01-07T09:05:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-01-07T08:14:45.950+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T21:30:39.792+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-139105\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 64.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511884\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2007]]}, \"title\": \"A Distributed Approach to Context-Aware Networks : Prototype System Design, Implementation, and Evaluation\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Swenson\", \"given\": \"Markus\", \"localId\": \"u1183a11\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Kanter\", \"given\": \"Theo G.\", \"localId\": \"u10l6taa\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Research\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Utilizing context information and in networks, enabling network services to act upon context information, and exchanging context information with applications, constitutes an important new approach to designing communication systems and central to the research project named Ambient Networks.

Another approach is dynamic advertisement insertion, which inserts advertisements at run-time while the media is being streamed. Dynamic advertisement insertion gives operators the flexibility to insert advertisements based on context, such as the user's geographic location or the user's preferences. Developing a technique to successfully insert advertisements dynamically into the streaming media has several challenges, such as maintaining synchronization of the media, choosing the appropriate transport format for media delivery, and finding a splicing boundary that starts with a key frame. The details of these challenges are detailed in this thesis.\\nWe carried out extensive research to find the best transport format for delivery of media and we studied prior work in an effort to find an appropriate streaming solution to perform dynamic advertisement insertion.

It introduces a new authenticator that implements such a new non-binary authentication mechanism.\\nIn today\\u2019s wireless local area networks it is generally not possible to continue a multimedia roaming session smoothly, because of the long delay caused by authentication \\u2013 during which no traffic other than authentication traffic is permitted. In the best cases this high delay results in a long communication interruption interval without media, while in the worst cases the session is aborted by the higher layer application as the application believes that the connectivity is lost. Thus introducing a more appropriate authentication mechanism enables mobile users who move into a new wireless local area network cell to continue to send and receive packets with greatly reduced handover latency (in comparison to existing authentication mechanisms). This new authentication mechanism potentially enables seamless roaming for users of conversational multimedia services (for example, a voice over IP call could continue despite a movement from one cell to another).\\nThis thesis demonstrates that it is possible to allow unauthenticated users to immediately begin to communicate, while simultaneously limiting their traffic. These limitations in traffic are implemented by traffic shaping.

A handheld device equipped with IEEE 802.11b wireless local area network connectivity and a RFID reader is then used by the medical staff to read the patient\\u2019s wristband, identify the patient, and access the relevant records of this patient.\\nThis work was carried out at the Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering at the University College Hospital Galway (UCHG), Ireland and the National University of Ireland, Galway.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92014\", \"number-of-pages\": \"91\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2007-13\", \"keyword\": \"wireless patient identification; positive patient identification; radio frequency identification\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-26T10:47:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T16:07:20.483+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:14:31.840+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92014\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 91.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511675\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2007]]}, \"title\": \"A Presence Server for Context-aware Applications\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Eslami\", \"given\": \"Mohammad Zarifi\", \"localId\": \"u19td70a\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This master\\u2019s thesis project \\u201cA Presence Server for Context-aware Applications\\u201d was carried out at KTH Center for Wireless Systems (Wireless@KTH). The overall goal of this thesis project is to implement a context aware infrastructure to serve as middleware for different kinds of context aware applications, such as a context-aware printing application, location based notifier application, etc. This thesis examines different types of context aware architectures and considers different forms of context modeling. Additionally the thesis also explores some of the related technology, in order to provide the reader with suitable background information to understand the rest of the thesis. By using the SIP Express Router (SER) and its presence module (pa) a context server has been designed, implemented, and evaluated. Evaluation reveals that the critical bottleneck is the increasing service time as the number of Publish messages for different events in the SER database increases, i.e. the time required for handling and sending the Notify messages when a new Publish message is received increases as a function of the number of earlier Publish messages. The evaluation also shows that the dependence of SER upon the MySQL database as incorrect database queries can cause SER to crash. Additionally the performance of the database limits the performance of the context server. A number of future improvements are necessary to address security issues (in particular the authentication of Watchers) and adding policy based control in order to send Notify messages only to the Watchers authorized to receive information for a specific event.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91937\", \"number-of-pages\": \"160\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2007-27\", \"keyword\": \"Context; Context-aware; SIP; SIP-SIMPLE; XML; PIDF; SER; Presence Agent module; Subscribe message; Publish message; Notify message\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T13:57:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-22T16:20:15.805+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:15:34.748+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91937\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 160.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:456514\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2011]]}, \"title\": \"A Proxy for Distributed Hash Table based Machine-to-Machine Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Li\", \"given\": \"Daoyuan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": null, \"abstract\": \"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been an increasingly interest for both researchers and entrepreneurs.

This thesis specifically looks at how to design and implement a proxy for such a system. We discuss why such a proxy can be useful for DHT-based M2M systems, what the proxy should consist of, and what kind of architecture is suitable. We also look into different communication protocols that can be used in these systems and discuss which ones best suit our purposes. The design of the proxy focuses on network management and service discovery of WSNs, and security considerations as well as caching mechanisms in order to improve performance. A prototype is implemented based on our design and evaluated. We find it feasible to implement such a DHT-based M2M system and a proxy in the system can be necessary and useful.

The proposed highly scalable database system is designed to support a Remote Patient Monitoring system (RPMS). In an RPMS, a wide range of applications are enabled by collecting health related measurement results from a number of medical devices in the patient\\u2019s home, parsing and formatting these results, and transmitting them from the patient\\u2019s home to specific data stores. Subsequently, another set of applications will communicate with these data stores to provide clinicians with the ability to observe, examine, and analyze these health related measurements in (near) real-time. Because of the rapid expansion in the number of patients utilizing RPMS, it is becoming a challenge to store, manage, and process the very large number of health related measurements that are being collected. The primary reason for this problem is that most RPMSs are built on top of traditional relational databases, which are inefficient when dealing with this very large amount of data (often called \\u201cbig data\\u201d).This thesis project analyzes scalable data management to support RPMSs, introduces a new set of open-source technologies that efficiently store and manage any amount of data which might be used in conjunction with such a scalable RPMS based upon HBase, implements these technologies, and as a proof of concept, compares the prototype data management system with the performance of a traditional relational database (specifically MySQL). This comparison considers both a single node and a multi node cluster. The comparison evaluates several critical parameters, including performance, scalability, and load balancing (in the case of multiple nodes). The amount of data used for testing input/output (read/write) and data statistics performance is 1, 10, 50, 100, and 250 GB.The thesis presents several ways of dealing with large amounts of data and develops &amp; evaluates a highly scalable database that could be used with a RPMS. Several software suites were used to compare both relational and non-relational systems and these results are used to evaluate the performance of the prototype of the proposed RPMS. The results of benchmarking show that MySQL is better than HBase in terms of read performance, while HBase is better in terms of write performance. Which of these types of databases should be used to implement a RPMS is a function of the expected ratio of reads and writes. Learning this ratio should be the subject of a future thesis project.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-124603\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiv,86\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:195\", \"keyword\": \"Big data; database performance; scalability; load balancing; Remote Patient Monitoring System; Big data; databas; prestanda; skalbarhet; lastbalansering; Remote Patient Monitoring System\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-07-18T13:10:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-07-18T12:34:55.038+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T23:50:46.956+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-124603\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 100.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:540758\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"A Security Study for Non-Internet Connected Managed Software\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Galassi De Orchi\", \"given\": \"Tommaso\", \"localId\": \"u1zdn2sp\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Fransson\", \"given\": \"Jonas\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"SCANIA CV AB\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Jarngren\", \"given\": \"Fredrik\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"SCANIA CV AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This master thesis project aims to improve the security of managed software developed at SCANIA's research and development group NEVE.

Exploiting advanced voice coding &amp; compression techniques and bandwidth sharing over packet switched networks, VoIP can dramatically improve bandwidth efficiency. Moreover enhanced security features, mobility support, and cost reduction features of VoIP are making it a popular choice for personal communication. Due to its rapid growth in popularity VoIP is rapidly becoming the next generation phone system.\\nLawful interception is a mean of monitoring private communication of users that are suspected of criminal activities or to be a threat to national security. However, government regulatory bodies and law enforcement agencies are becoming conscious of the difficulty of lawful interception of public communication due to the mobilitysupport and advanced security features implemented in some implementations of VoIP technology. There has been continuous pressure from the government upon the operators and vendors to find a solution that would make lawful interception feasible and successful. Key escrow was proposed as a solution by the U. S. National Security Agency. In key escrow the key(s) for a session are entrusted to a trusted third party and upon proper authorization law enforcement agencies can receive the session key(s) from this trusted third party However, key escrow adds some security vulnerabilities and potential risks as an unethical employee of the key escrow agent (or a law enforcement agency that has received the session key(s)) can misuse the key(s) to forge content of a communication session -- as he or she possesses the same key(s) as the user used for this session.\\nThis thesis addresses the issue of forged session content, by proposing, implementing, and evaluating a cryptographic model which allows key escrow session content.

Therefore it is absolutely essential to constantly evaluate and optimize processes to achieve shorter time-to-market for products.These optimizations have to be carried out in all parts of a company. This thesis describes one such attempt made by a Swedish telecommunication vendor focused on enabling a resource management system to gain a greater understanding of the resources available during testing. This system manages all of the hardware utilized by the users, software testers, within one particular part of the organization and aids users by automatically converting the information stored in its database into a configuration file that will later be used in the testing framework\\u2019s execution environment. Unfortunately, the current version of this resource management system lacks semantic understanding of the information necessary to automatically generate the configuration file, leaving a rather large part of the configuration file to be manually entered by the testers, a rather time-consuming task. The inability to completely automate the process means that the testing process is slower, more error prone, and increases the work needed for a new engineer to become a productive software tester.In order for the resource management system to automatically generate the configuration file it needs to know not only which resources it is managing, but must also how these resources are interconnected, i.e. the topology of the resources. For this reason this thesis describes how to make the resource management system topologically aware, thus making verification of the System under Test (SUT) more efficient and mitigating the problems mentioned above. This thesis does not deal with the intricate details of how to automatically extract the topology, as this is inherently domain specific and thus difficult to generalize. Rather, this thesis focused on how to allow users to custom-build their desired topology by defining a set of rules that restrict how resources can be interconnected.The goal of providing functionality for storing and retrieving topological information from database has been successfully achieved, and the resulting code has been integrated into the existing resource management system. However, the functionality has not yet been delivered because of a limitation in our front controller that stops us from providing an efficient web interface to our tool. After delivery the implemented solution is expected to remove most manual work related to test configuration and therefore also reduce the learning curve for new engineers.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-139949\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,100\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2014:1\", \"keyword\": \"Topology; Resource Management System; SUT; Testing; Topologi; Resurshanteringssystem; SUT; Testning\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-01-16T21:00:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-01-15T17:54:34.211+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T21:21:52.159+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-139949\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 113.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:507866\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2011]]}, \"title\": \"A Web Server for Sensors\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Tian\", \"given\": \"Ye\", \"localId\": \"u1jh5fbo\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This thesis describes the project \\u201cA new Web Server for sensors\\u201d. The project has created a demonstration web service that can receive data from sensors ( both fixed sensors and movable sensors) and distribute the received information in the form of web pages. These web pages can provide forms that enable the user to enter commands which are to be given to sensors. The aim of this thesis project was to design and evaluate web-based application which could utilize sensor data. In this project, we focused on two aspects: (1) web access to sensors and (2) the potentialmobility of sensors. The web server provides web server mediated access to the sensors. Additionally, this project examined how to integrate a sensor with a mobile device, such as a personal data appliance. The web server provides an easy acces smechanism to users who want to use and control sensors. Those users can flexibly us etheir web browser to access to sensors through our web server. Moreover, a sensor could move, for example because it is integrated with a personal data appliance. The mobility of sensors increases the sensing scope of sensors because the sensors are notfixed in position. Such sensors can sense the environment along the path that they are moved.\\nTo achieve the goals of this thesis project, we analyzed what are the basic parts and functions that should exist for sensors in the web server. Furthermore, the thesis analyzed how a sensor can be integrated with a personal data appliance, for instance,how to supply the power to sensor; and how to synchronize data between the sensor and personal data appliance. As a result of this project, a web server with some of the necessary functions was developed. An approach of how to integrate a sensor with a personal data appliance is specified in this thesis.\\nThe thesis begins with an analysis of some existing solutions. Their advantages were used to specify the requirements for our own solution. The thesis describes the design and implementation of this proposed solution. Next the thesis describes the testing and evaluation of this solution in the context of this project.

The biggest challenge of information and communication technology (ICT) today is to transition from IPv4 to IPv6. The purpose of this thesis is to accelerate the adoption of IPv6 by highlighting the benefits of it compared to IPv4.Although the need for more IP-addresses is the most urgent incentive for the transition to IPv6, other factors also exist. IPv6 offers many improvements to IPv4 which are necessary for the continued expansion of Internet-based applications and services.Some argue that we do not need to transition to IPv6 as the problems with IPv4, mainly the addressshortage, can be solved in other ways. One of the methods of doing this is by extending the use of Network Address Translators (NATs), but the majority of experts and specialists believe that NATs should not be seen as a long-term solution.Another difficulty with the new protocol is explaining its benefits and areas of use to both the business world and the public. Understanding these benefits are necessary in order create awareness of these benefits, thus to accelerating the adoption of IPv6.

Recommendations to limit physically meeting with others caused somewhat of a paradigm shift in how office workers perform their work. A massive shift to remote work occurred and exposed the workforce to the remote work\\u2019s shortcomings and problems. Based on a literature study, remote workers were found to lack social interactions that happen automatically in an office. Therefore, a proposed solution of scheduling regular, social, and informal interaction sessions was tested in an experiment using Microsoft Teams with full-time, remote IT workers. To facilitate informal social interactions during these experiment sessions, the participants were allowed to play a few different games, participate in social activities or not participate at all. Analysis of the results from the experiment showed a slight improvement in the measured factors over the course of the experiment. However, only a decrease in emotional exhaustion was found to be statistically significant. Therefore, the results are insufficient to argue for or against the implementation of regular informal social interactions with a goal of improving employees\\u2019 remote working environment. The experiment had several areas which could be improved, particularly the scale and availability of the experiment. Future research should take into account the suggested areas of improvement for the experiment, specifically scaling up a similar experiment in order to support or refute the implementation of regular social interactions as part of a remote working environment. The increase in remote work is believed to persist in the future. Therefore, the drawbacks of remote work merit additional research to uncover techniques to mitigate them.

However, due to factors such as radio interference and cell load, the throughput available to a client varies over time. If the throughput available to a client decreases below the media\\u2019s bit rate, the client\\u2019s buffer will eventually become empty. This causes the client to enter a period of rebuffering, which degrades user experience. In order to avoid this, a streaming server may provide the media at different bit rates, thereby allowing the media\\u2019s bit rate (and quality) to be modified to fit the client\\u2019s bandwidth. This is referred to as <i>adaptive streaming</i>.\\nThe aim of this thesis is to devise an algorithm to find the media quality most suitable for a specific client, focusing on how to detect that the user is able to receive content at a higher rate. The goal for such an algorithm is to avoid depleting the client buffer, while utilizing as much of the bandwidth available as possible without overflowing the buffers in the network. In particular, this thesis looks into the difficult problem of how to do adaptation for live content and how to switch to a content version with higher bitrate and quality in an optimal way.\\nThis thesis examines if existing adaptation mechanisms can be improved by considering the characteristics of different mobile networks. In order to achieve this, a study of mobile networks currently in use has been conducted, as well as experiments with streaming over live networks. The experiments and study indicate that the increased available throughput can <b>not</b> be detected by passive monitoring of client feedback. Furthermore, a higher data rate carrier will <b>not </b>be allocated to a client in 3G networks, unless the client is sufficiently utilizing the current carrier. This means that a streaming server must modify its sending rate in order to find its maximum throughput and to force allocation of a higher data rate carrier. Different methods for achieving this are examined and discussed and an algorithm based upon these ideas was implemented and evaluated. It is shown that increasing the transmission rate by introducing stuffed packets in the media stream allows the server to find the optimal bit rate for live video streams without switching up to a bit rate which the network can not support.\\nThis thesis was carried out during the summer and autumn of 2008 at Ericsson Research, Multimedia Technologies in Kista, Sweden.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91662\", \"number-of-pages\": \"102\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2008-28\", \"keyword\": \"Streaming; Bit rate adaption; Video Quality; RTP; RTCP; GPRS; EDGE; UMTS\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-20T10:11:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-19T15:37:32.278+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:20:00.970+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91662\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 102.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:512696\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2006]]}, \"title\": \"Adaptive Wireless Multimedia Services\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Yi\", \"given\": \"Xiaokun\", \"localId\": \"u1g863eo\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Context-awareness is a hot topic in mobile computing currently. A lot of importance is being attached to facilitating the user of various mobile computing devices to provide services that are more \\u201cuser-centric\\u201d. One aspect of context-awareness is to perceive variations in available resources, and to make decisions based on the feedback to enable applications to automatically adapt to the current environment.\\nFor Voice over IP (VoIP) software phones (softphones), variations in network performance lead to fluctuations in the quality of the communication. Therefore, by making these softphones more adaptive to the network environment will, to some extent, mask such fluctuations. Dynamic voice and video adaptation derives from the fact that different coder-decoders (CODEC) have different characteristics, even the same CODECs with a different configuration can behave quite differently, in terms of bandwidth consumption, packet size, etc.\\nMinisip is a VoIP client application which was implemented on and targeted for a Linux platform. One of my tasks was to port Minisip to Microsoft\\u2019s Windows Mobile operating system, running on an HP IPAQ Pocket PC H5550. Such handheld computer enables the user to communication while they are moving about, thus increasing the probability that the characteristics of the network connection will change. Building upon this port, the next task was to add dynamic voice and video CODEC adaptation. Dynamic voice and video CODEC adaptation on Minisip poses several challenges, for example, in what way can the network performance be determined and what adaptation strategy can achieve high call quality while making efficient utilization of available network resources.\\nIn order to make the proper design choices, several estimation models will be discussed, these are used to determine an efficient, un-intrusive, and light weight means of dynamic CODEC selection within Minisip. This thesis only implemented audio CODEC adaptation of Minisip, and the evaluation of the resulting prototype shows that such dynamic adaptation is <b>both</b> feasible and practical; further more, video CODEC adaptation would be a more significant extension to this work in the future.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92208\", \"number-of-pages\": \"44\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2006-12\", \"keyword\": \"VOIP; SIP; Minisip; Adaptation; CODEC\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-29T08:52:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-28T16:37:48.967+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:11:11.132+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92208\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 44.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511017\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2008]]}, \"title\": \"Adding bandwidth specification to a AAA Sever\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Zhou\", \"given\": \"Jia\", \"localId\": \"u1s65uon\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) are key elements in network security. In many networks, clients can use resources only after they have been authenticated by an authentication server and authorized to use these resources. In some cases the server will also maintain accounting records in order for an operator (a provider of resources) to charge the account/subscriber for using the service. There are four main AAA protocols being used today. Of these RADIUS is the mostly widely used.\\nThis thesis starts with an introduction to AAA protocols, and then goes in the details of RADIUS. In order to perform a practical evaluation of how the AAA could be improved, FreeRADIUS was selected as the base code for this project; because this implementation is one of the most widely used RADIUS servers. A proposal for how to improve AAA performance is introduced and the implementation steps needed to realize these improvements are shown. Additionally, some experiments have been conducted to show both the correct functioning of the resulting implementation and to examine if there is a performance improvement. Following this some conclusions are drawn based upon a comparison with a traditional AAA server.\\nA key element of the change in AAA which is proposed is the use of a non-binary IEEE 802.1x process. This new non-binary solution introduces a new type of AAA server and requires the re-thinking of a number of traditional AAA design decisions. It is expected that this change will have a significant impact, but will require some time for exposure, implementation by others, and a more extensive evaluation that was possible during the period of this thesis project.\\nOne of the most important conclusions drawn during this thesis is the difficulty of making a change in authentication and authorization, because of the large amount of interaction between both the various protocols and the standards which have been developed for these protocols. Thus one of the difficult aspects of the task is how to introduce a change in a protocol while maintaining backward compatibility for others who have not adopted this change -- without requiring the addition of a protocol version field.\\nA second important conclusion is that doing this implementation in three separate parts with different students being responsible for the different parts revealed just how complex the interaction of protocol design decisions are. While a working version of the entire set of changes proved to be impossible, it was observed that the different parts could be decoupled more than initially expected.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91684\", \"number-of-pages\": \"104\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2008-19\", \"keyword\": \"AAA; RADIUS; FreeRADIUS; authentication; non-binary authentication; IEEE 802.1x\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-20T10:37:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-19T16:50:17.110+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:19:29.941+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91684\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 104.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:531126\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"Adding Gigabit Ethernet to an ATM Switch\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Badinson (nee Hossieni)\", \"given\": \"David\", \"localId\": \"u1e80ym2\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}, {\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Nordmark\", \"given\": \"Roger\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Telecom AB, Datacom Networks and Services\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This document contains the outcome of the final version of my thesis project: Adding Gigabit Ethernet access to an ATM switch.

This thesis first collects failures/non conformities in test sessions and stores it into databases. A failure/non-conformity is processed by many engineers from the time it is detected in a test until it is resolved.\\u00a0 This thesis project seeks to investigate the exchange and the management of failures in both the tools and databases, together with analyzing the interaction between engineers through tools and databases.

For developers this incompatibility increases the difficulty when creating software.Lack of resources for testing the application may lead to the application being limited to either just a specific model or in some cases to only one specific version of the operating system software.

It opens up new possibilities for global communication. But the number of services is growing, and you get more and more addresses to keep track of \\u2013 one or more for each service (email, homepage, etc.). Not only that, the addresses are tied to your employer, school, or service provider. That is, they are not very portable and persistent. Another problem is how to integrate Internet telephony with ordinary telephony. Besides setting up the necessary infrastructure, for example gateways, one of the biggest problems is the addressing incompatibility. Phones on the telephone network use telephone numbers while hosts on the Internet use IP addresses or domain names. How can you call a host named foo.ellemtel.se from an ordinary telephone, as you can only dial numbers?\\nThis thesis begins with a general introduction to concepts and previous work related to the problems described above. Then two approaches aiming to solve these problems are presented. They are based on Unique Identification Numbers, or UINs, which are globally unique, persistent, and portable addresses. All of your addresses can be aggregated under one UIN, which acts as an alias for your real addresses. A real address could be found by specifying an UIN along with the desired service. And since UINs have E.164 number format, they can be used on both the Internet and in the telephony network, thus eliminating the incompatibility problem. For example, when you send an email to an UIN the real email address will be looked up and used transparently to the user.\\nThe UIN architecture is based on DNS and directory services (LDAP, Whois++, etc.), and lives side-by-side with normal addressing. The scalability of DNS is combined with the flexibility of directory services.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-96523\", \"number-of-pages\": \"57\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-14T10:42:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-05T15:34:14.265+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:19:08.417+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-96523\", \"note\": \"The full text of the thesis can be found at:\\nhttp://www.student.nada.kth.se/~d93-jsv/exjobb/reports/js_addressing_architecture.pdf\", \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 57.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511398\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2008]]}, \"title\": \"An Intelligent Presentation System\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Lidan\", \"given\": \"Hu\", \"localId\": \"u17kruxm\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The master thesis project - Personal video: An Intelligent Presentation System (IPS) - was conducted at the Department of Communication Systems, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden.

Effective in this context means that a visualization can be understood accurately or rapidly by the viewer. However, how to visualize geospatial time series data effectively is challenging. The challenge consists of how to visualize geospatial time-dependent data in a single view that can provide both an effective overview and details of the data set. With three or more data dimensions the available coding options grows; hence, the challenge consists in combining several visual coding and viewing options into a single effective view. This thesis investigated visualization guidelines that should promote effectivness for a visualization of geospatial time-dependent data. Furthermore, in this project the data set consisted of historical air temperature measurements in Sweden, which has both geospatial and time-dependent features. The guidelines where used in an iterative design process to redesign an existing geospatial time series visualization. The goal of the redesign was to increase the effectiveness of the existing visualization. An alternative visualization was created and compared to the original visualization in a user study. The results indicate that these users experienced the alternative visualization as more effective than the original. However, the performance of the participants on four tasks indicates that the alternative visualization is not more effective. Furthermore, compared to related work the alternative visualization is not more effective. In conclusion, the alternative visualization is harder to learn than the original which may have an effect on the user\\u2019s performance. However, once the visualization is learned, then it may be more effective than the original visualization.

The increasing demand for network bandwidth is becoming a huge problem. To solve this problem, new methods must be developed. Ericsson\\u2019s solution is the use of MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS). MPLS has the potential to have a major impact on IP networking. It has the simplicity and dynamic nature of an IP network, but retains the performance of an ATM network. Furthermore, from an administrator\\u2019s point of view, MPLS will drastically simplify network management.\\nThe key principle behind MPLS is to be able to forward by switching packets through a network instead of routing packets. In order to do this, paths are established at the data link layer throughout the MPLS network. A fixed length identifier known as \\u201clabel\\u201d identifies each path. Then the packets are simply forwarded on the path using layer two switching, instead of performing layer three routing.\\nBy using MPLS, performance is increased and it provides a good basis for traffic engineering, Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees, and Virtual Private Networks (VPN).\\nI have implemented an MPLS ATM driver for an Ericsson AXI 510 Edge Router. The driver is responsible for converting generic MPLS labels into standard ATM labels (VPI/VCI). The driver also modifies the forwarding process in the router so that ATM paths are used to forward the packets, instead of the conventional forwarding methods. This implementation has been partly tested and it complies with MPLS current Internet drafts so far.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95463\", \"number-of-pages\": \"61\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-15T08:01:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-05-25T14:48:04.204+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:29:21.984+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95463\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 61.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:938973\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2016]]}, \"title\": \"Analysis and Evaluation of Network Management Solutions : A Comparison of Network Management Solutions Suitable for Networks with 2,500+ Devices\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Gabdurahmanov\", \"given\": \"Murat\", \"localId\": \"u1ii1v1b\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Trygg\", \"given\": \"Simon\", \"localId\": \"u13xh64b\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Erdogan\", \"given\": \"Yeliz\", \"affiliation\": []}], \"abstract\": \"Some companies today are using sub-optimal and nearly obsolete management systems for their networks.

As one of the most successful and popular UGC systems, YouTube contributes a great share of Internet traffic volume and has attracted a lot of academic interest. The continuously increasing amount of IP traffic motivates the need for better network design, more efficient content distribution mechanisms, and more sustainable system development. Web caching is one of the widely used techniques to reduce the inter Internet Service Provider (ISP) traffic. Web caching is considered an important part in the design of a content distribution infrastructure.This master\\u2019s thesis utilizes a one month trace of YouTube traffic in two residential networks in Sweden. Based upon a systematic and in-depth measurement we focus on analyzing the geographic locality of traffic patterns within small areas for these two networks. We summarize the YouTube traffic characteristics and user replay patterns, and then discuss why caching can be useful for YouTube-like systems.We present the optimal caching gain on a per area basis and also divide users into two groups: PC and mobile device users to show the caching gain for these two groups. Overall, an infinite capacity proxy cache for each small area could reduce the YouTube streaming data traffic by 30% to 45%. The result presented in this paper help us to understand YouTube traffic and user behaviors and provides valuable information for the ISPs to enable them to design more efficient caching mechanisms.When this work began we thought that a reduction of backhaul traffic (especially for mobile operators) may delay the need to make investments in upgrading their network capacity. However, an important conclusion from this thesis project is that the cache efficiency depends on the terminal type. For mobile terminals (smart phones, iPads, etc) a terminal cache solution is found to be the most efficient. For PCs in fixed networks, a network cache would be more efficient. It should be noted that the mobile terminals covered in the project are connected through home Wi-Fi, so further research is needed in order to draw definite conclusions for caching solutions for cellular networks.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-104195\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,60\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:246\", \"keyword\": \"UGC; YouTube; Geographic locality; Caching gain; UGC; YouTube; geografiskt definierade populationer; mellanlagring\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-10-31T14:06:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-10-30T08:57:09.810+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T02:45:59.830+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-104195\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 73.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:460412\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2011]]}, \"title\": \"Anonymous Authentication Using Secure Multi-Party Computations\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Ahmad\", \"given\": \"Maqsood\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Typical authentication systems provide a method to allow registered users access to protected resources after the user successfully authenticates.

PONs are being tried as a method of extending optical fibres into the access network. PONs offer the ability of sharing the transmission costs of the access network amongst a large number of customers by allowing fibre and bandwidth sharing via passive optical splitters. ITU-T recommendation G.983 defines a specification for ATM based PONs. An SDL model was used in the project to investigate the possibility of using the Ericsson ATM switch (AXD 301) as the head-end in a G.983 compliant PON (i.e., the OLT). Also some simulations was made, using SDT. The results indicated that the ATM switch could very well serve as an OLT (by addition of a connection board). It was concluded that although the complexity of the system is quite high (caused by the TDMA technique used), it is a feasible solution. A techno-economical analysis made in the initial part of this project indicates that PONs are too expensive for deployment in the near future, compared to enhanced copper networks using xDSL technology. However, new applications could boost demand for high bandwidth sooner than expected. In any case, PONs (except in the FTTH configuration) constitute a natural upgrade for enhanced copper networks.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95451\", \"number-of-pages\": \"57\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-15T07:54:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-05-25T12:44:34.304+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:29:39.066+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95451\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 57.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:536315\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1995]]}, \"title\": \"ATM UNI 155 MB/s Interface\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Mickos\", \"given\": \"Lars-Erik\", \"localId\": \"u13rjgda\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Vatn\", \"given\": \"Jon-Olof\", \"localId\": \"u1op1pjc\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Raquette\", \"given\": \"Erik\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"ATM is the backbone network selected by the CCITT to carry the future B-ISDN services.

These devices coexist, on many occasions, with non-portable devices, such as fixed phones and personal computers. All these devices have something in common. The user\\u2019s state is not taken into account when they provide their service. This results in the user being constantly interrupted, when not desired or missing very urgent notification(s) if the devices are turned off. Additionally, having so many different devices, each providing unique and different notifications, consumes unnecessary time from the user, who must attend to them separately.In order to improve this situation we seek to exploit the improvements in the fields of speaker and speech recognition, and text to speech synthesis. We were also inspired by the concept \\u201cNomadic Radio\\u201d.

Hence, this thesis studied how to exploit audio for mobile users, by building a client/server application using \\u201cSmartBadge version 4\\u201d. This application consists of a playlist manager that will manage audio files by placing them in the appropriate position in the playlist as various clients dynamically generate new audio content or send pre-existing content such as MPEG files. This application interacts with several clients, all communicating via the UDP protocol. One of these clients provides a user interface for selecting audio files and determining the order in which to play them. Another client uses text-to-speech synthesis to generate audio alerts. Another client is a player for several different types of audio files, enabling a user to listen to these files (songs in different formats, notifications,...) all on the same device, resulting in an approximation of a \\u201cNomadic Radio\\u201d with the sensor rich \\u201cSmartBadge version 4\\u201d as the underlying hardware platform.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93197\", \"number-of-pages\": \"102\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-IMIT-LCN.

Software agents deployed on smart things are remotely accessible, host sensitive resources, and often represent high value targets.

In this thesis, we aim to rectify this deficiency by introducing platform independent, exible, and user centric authorization mechanism inSWoT.We derive requirements and design of abstract authorization architecture from the preceding seminal work performed in SENSEI project. SENSEI and SWoT share same problem domain, but while SENSEI addresses enterprise use cases SWoT focusses on consumer use cases. This single but fundamental difference motivates adaptations of SENSEI contributions for application in SWoT. To realize concrete authorization architecture we perform extensive study of various authorization solutions. Results of our study indicate that novel User Managed Access (UMA) protocol represents promising solution for SWoT.We present the Authorization as a Service solution for SWoT framework, based on UMA protocol. This solution enables users to manage and control communication between software agents deployed on smart things and in the cloud from single centralized location. It also features runtime association of software agents, management, evaluation, and enforcement of access permissions for resources provided by software agents.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-134639\", \"number-of-pages\": \"ix, 105\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:231\", \"keyword\": \"SWoT; Security; Authorization; User Managed Access; Web p\\u00e5 saker; s\\u00e4kerhet; tillst\\u00e5nd; anv\\u00e4ndarhanterad tillg\\u00e5ng\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-12-18T12:48:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-11-27T09:47:33.368+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T22:17:36.315+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-134639\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 114.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:546619\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"Authorization schema for electronic health-care records : For Uganda\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Fern\\u00e1ndez\", \"given\": \"Alexis Mart\\u00ednez\", \"localId\": \"u1km4cs3\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This master\\u2019s thesis project began at the Karolinska University Hospital.

In addition, when applied to agile software development, the reduced time required for testing because of the use of our tool helps shortening the feedback loops between designing and testing, thus increasing team efficiency within every iteration.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93852\", \"number-of-pages\": \"151\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:55\", \"keyword\": \"Model-Based Testing; Automated Model Generation; Graphical User Interface; State Chart\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-05-04T08:13:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-05-01T23:33:46.961+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:45:00.902+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93852\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 151.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:526410\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"Automated test procedure for GSM Over-The-Air SIM file management\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Andr\\u00e9\", \"given\": \"Johan\", \"localId\": \"u1y3doxa\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Lindgren\", \"given\": \"Staffan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"AU-SYSMOBILE\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Developments of new Servers for Over-the-Air SIM file management and SIM Toolkit applications require a comprehensive test procedure to verify their operation.

Reliable networks are important to deliver services that live up to customers' expectations. Tests are frequently run on Ericsson's systems in order to identify stability problems in their networks. These tests are not always completely reliable. The logs produced by these tests are gathered and analyzed to identify abnormal system behavior, especially abnormal behavior that the tests might not have caught. To automate this analysis process, a machine learning system, called the Awesome Automatic Log Analysis Application (AALAA), is used at Ericsson's Continuous Integration Infrastructure (CII)-department to identify problems within the large logs produced by automated Radio Base Station test loops and processes. AALAA is currently operable in two versions using different distributed cluster computing platforms: Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop. However, it needs improvements in its machine-to-machine communication to make this process more convenient to use. In this thesis, message communication has successfully been implemented in the AALAA system. The result is a message bus deployed in RabbitMQ that is able to successfully initiate model training and abnormal log identification through requests, and to handle a continuous flow of result updates from AALAA.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-168837\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,28\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2015:55\", \"keyword\": \"Big Data; Machine learning; Message passing; Machine-to-machine communication; Big Data; Maskininl\\u00e4rning; Meddelandes\\u00e4ndning; Maskin-till-maskin kommunikation\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-06-09T10:57:17.904+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-06-09T08:54:47.250+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T13:52:38.918+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-168837\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 41.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:816005\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2015]]}, \"title\": \"Automating Interactions with Web Services : NFC based attendance software in Java\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Johansson\", \"given\": \"Carl\", \"localId\": \"u1k544z9\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Kavosi\", \"given\": \"Soren\", \"localId\": \"u1nuxs5n\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Today we use an obsolete way of handling information regarding which student and/or teacher is attending which class/lab/seminar, attendance is written down on a piece of paper and collected so that an administrator can manually enter this information to some data processing system.This method is far from optimal and demands a lot of time and resources from administrators, teachers, and students. Correct gathering of attendance is important since it is required for specific parts of some courses. We propose to automate the collection of this attendance data, thus enabling students and teachers to simply swipe their NFC-enabled KTH access card in order to enter their name on an attendance list. This will be achieved by creating an application that adds a student to an attendance list by reading information using a NFC/RFID reader and mapping the card\\u2019s UID to a KTHID (a locally unique identifier used within the university) using a database. The resulting attendance list should be formatted in such a fashion that it can easily be uploaded to systems such as KTH Social and Daisy. Ideally these systems will be extended so that instructors/teachers can use this attendance list to automatically create the appropriate entries in these systems to record the student\\u2019s participation in the indicated activity \\u2013 in the process avoiding a lot of manual labor and improving the accuracy of the process.An additional problem is that there is currently no unified system that connects the KTH access card database (BRAVIDA) to the KTH LDAP database (which stores information about KTH students, faculty, and staff). This means that each student\\u2019s access card UID must manually be added to a database together with the student\\u2019s KTHID. However, once this database entry has been made, we can then map from a card number to a KTHID (or the reverse).The purpose behind and expected result of this thesis is a functional prototype of an application that creates an attendance list by reading data from the student or teacher\\u2019s access cards using a NFC reader. This will hopefully stimulate further digitalization in KTH and also encourage more courses to utilize such access card based attendance lists. The result should be less manual effort by students, faculty, and staff, as well as more accurate and timely filing of attendance information for courses.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-168381\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,51\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2015:47\", \"keyword\": \"student attendance; application; access card; NFC reader; prototype; studentn\\u00e4rvaro; applikation; accesskort; NFC-l\\u00e4sare; prototyp\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-06-02T13:45:53.623+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-06-02T12:31:45.814+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T14:05:03.160+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-168381\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 64.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1322389\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2019]]}, \"title\": \"Automatisering av aktiv lyssnare processen inom examensarbetesseminarium : En ut\\u00f6kning av l\\u00e4rplattformen Canvas\", \"language\": \"swe\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Kuvaja Rabhi\", \"given\": \"Karim\", \"localId\": \"u14zycbu\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879305\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"I dagsl\\u00e4get n\\u00e4r studenter fr\\u00e5n Kungliga Tekniska H\\u00f6gskolan (KTH) ska genomf\\u00f6ra en examensarbetspresentation ska det finnas aktiva lyssnare p\\u00e5 plats.

Differentiated Services (DiffServ) appeared in mid-1997 is a scheme designed to achieve this. The DiffServ architecture is based on a simple model where the traffic entering a network is classified and possibly conditioned at the boundaries of the network, and then assigned to different behavior aggregates. It is done by edge routers marking the packets. The core routers that forward the packets examine this marking and decide how the packet should be treated.\\nCompared to the original Type of Service (ToS) approach, the DiffServ effort has undertaken significant development in the area of admission control mechanisms, and this where the real value of the DiffServ approach lies. DiffServ attempts to divide one physical network into several 'virtual' networks with resources being allocated to each of them, by using the mechanisms such as classification, metering, shaping, dropping, queuing and scheduling. An overloaded service class will always yield poor service outcomes. Service quality can only be guaranteed when the traffic volume is limited to a realistic amount.\\nThis master thesis presents a software entity responsible for admission control, called Bandwidth Broker, for a DiffServ network. The idea of a bandwidth broker was introduced as part of the DiffServ architecture by Van Jacobsen. A bandwidth broker in this thesis is limited to being an entity responsible for admission control for bandwidth requests. Being aware of the network topology and the available bandwidth on each link, as well as the service level agreements (SLAs) to it's peering domains, the bandwidth broker can decide whether to admit the traffic to the network or not.\\nThe objective of the thesis is to analyze and evaluate how end-to-end QoS can be achieved by integrating bandwidth brokers with other management tools in a pure DiffServ environment. A prototype of a bandwidth broker in a single domain based on static resource management was designed, implemented and evaluated.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93536\", \"number-of-pages\": \"64\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-20T13:08:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-20T12:03:45.313+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:50:28.333+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93536\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 64.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:541129\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1995]]}, \"title\": \"BeCool (Broadband Enterprise Cooperative Language OR Beteus Cooperative Language)\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Lindblad\", \"given\": \"Janne\", \"localId\": \"u1285pg2\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Bilting\", \"given\": \"Ulf\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Stockman\", \"given\": \"Bernard\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"abstract\": null, \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98557\", \"number-of-pages\": null, \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-07-30T13:54:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-27T12:39:59.443+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T03:58:28.612+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98557\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 0.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:526655\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"Bi-directional Differentiated Services in aBroadband Access Server\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Ejner\", \"given\": \"Mikael\", \"localId\": \"u179lk0p\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Lowe\", \"given\": \"Kerry\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Datacom & IP Services\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Quality of Service (QoS) is a highly desired feature of an IP network. The best-effort quality of traffic behaviour that the Internet provides by default today is not enough for certain timing-, mission- and throughput-critical applications such as video conferencing.

This means that a user paying for premium FTP service will, when downloading a file, only get premium service for the requests, not for the actual file transfer.\\nThe goal of this project was to find a suitable method for making DiffServ bi-directional.\\nThis report presents the background and some available options, and motivates a preferred solution for the bi-directional Differentiated Services problem. The preferred option is, as the discussion shows, a centralised server-based solution with bi-directional DiffServ as an integrated feature of a policy-based network.

Since this node controls the traffic and thereby controls the QoS within the network its communicating behaviour is of great importance for maintaining QoS reservations. A central part in maintaining QoS reservations is the scheduler, which prioritises between different tasks to be done such as which device that is allowed to transmit next.\\nThere is no standardised way to implement the Bluetooth scheduler. However, a Bluetooth scheduler should be able to handle QoS reservations, maintain fairness among the participating nodes, and utilise the available bandwidth efficiently. Furthermore a key requirement in Bluetooth is simplicity, therefore a Bluetooth scheduling algorithm should be of low complexity.\\nThis master thesis presents a new patented solution for an intra-piconet scheduling algorithm that is capable of maintaining QoS reservation, while being fair and also meet the low complexity requirement.

The MEMO project will develop a common platform for an wireless asymmetric communication system that will consist of a broadband downstream channel (DAB) and narrowband upstream channels (GSM). They have also develop a framework of an architecture and a interface to the DAB channel for this purpose.Wireless asymmetric communication systems utelise the nature of an information retrieval session very well, because the request from the clients are very modest regarding demanded bandwidth in contrast to the server response which usually demand much bandwidth for downloading the requested information to the client.In my thesis project I have developed and implemented three different software's that will fit in the MEMO architecture and offer the user the specified functionality. That is, the user shall be able to retrieve information in broadcast and/or on-demand mode. The software's developed is a client part which will be running on the mobile host, a server software which will serve the client with the requested information, and a broadcast software which enables the content provider to broadcast specific content in their service. The broadcast channel is developed by Teracom.The result that this project has achieved is, first some measurement on a model of the system that shows the benefits with broadcast mode in the system.

Additionally mobile devices allow people to have connectivity, even when moving from place to place, additionally they are small in size and light in weight.

Cellular phone and smart phones have more function than before, with some newer models phone having an embedded GPS receiver. This GPS receiver can provide user with new services, in addition to location information. Many of these handheld devices include wireless LAN functionality, enabling people to walk from one place to another with a continuous network access, via either the WLAN or the cellular network. By using voice over IP, a wireless enabled hand device becomes a Virtual Cell Phone enabling low cost calls via the WLAN when the user is within coverage of an access point which will give them access, or via the normal cellular phone network (when with in coverage).\\nBecause the WLAN coverage is not ubiquitous, it is important to build a Wireless Network Coverage model to enable every user to see where there is WLAN network coverage. Present methods to create such a coverage map require a lot of work to collect data, both indoors and outdoors. Currently a lot of human effort is needed to collect, process, and format this data. The method proposed her could provide an easier way of gathering data from the field and be simple enough that even a normal user could collect data and contribute it to help generate a coverage model of areas where they visit.\\nThe measurements reported indicate that it is possible to combine data from multiple devices of the same and different types, but only when the signal strength is high.

A system is designed to monitor the measurement process with regards to detector velocity and height. The system will trigger a warning when the minimum detectable activity is too high, as it would lead to inconsistent results. This system consists of a cart-detector setup with a scintillation detector and velocity measurement device(s). Software will utilize the measurement data to implement the aforementioned monitoring.

The result of the part-analysis for each component of the system showed a large inaccuracy regarding the Intertial Measurement Units (IMUs); hence, the robotic wheels were chosen as the main method of measuring speed for this project. The robotic wheels and the detector were shown to be sufficiently accurate for the desired measurements. The Raspberry Pi 4 model B, the on- board computer, was also shown to be performance-wise and property-wise well suited for the project.

Simple text telephones have evolved into total conversation telephones with audio, video, and text all operating in real time.

The prototype was evaluated and based on the evaluation data a timeline was created. An overall positive response towards the product exists and the timeline had adding more third party services (such as Skype and FaceTime) as a high priority.

This has resulted in a wide-spread use of services in order to improve the quality of our daily life. For example, a person with a mobile device can use services to plan and execute his or her travel, to connect to family and friends, to perform his or her search, or to manage his or her business. However, most of these services might only be available at some times, they may lack robustness, and some of these services are not aware of (or do not exploit) the mobility of the user. These services appear impermeable to the end users, i.e. the end users do not get to control or configure the services. We envisage that end users, with no programming knowledge, will have a hard time to find services of their choice and that it will be hard for these end users to derive substantial benefits from these services. Unguided automation is not the answer to this problem, as a particular service suggested automatically by a dynamic composition mechanism may not be suitable for a specific user at a certain point of time and in a given context. On the other hand explicit specification of service instances will mean that the user will be bogged down with the problem of runtime optimization in a dynamic environment where the services having the required functionality may or may not be available.In order to address this issue we introduce the notion of intelligent service composition where the end user will have a great degree of flexibility to define his or her own rules or conditions based on which an optimal composition will be generated automatically from a set of collaborative services by adaptation in a specific context and at a specific point in time. This is a step forward when compared to the present dynamic composition mechanisms which do not facilitate end users defining their own conditions dictating the selection of specific service instance at runtime. We have developed this solution to bring end users towards adaptive use of services. We validated our solution through a scenario-based evaluation approach with an implementation of a proof-of-concept prototype.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-50073\", \"number-of-pages\": \"124\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2011:189\", \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-12-01T15:44:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-12-01T15:44:08.996+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T19:49:06.382+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-50073\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 124.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:510497\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2009]]}, \"title\": \"Collaboration-Oriented Modeling of an Offshore Group Communication System\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Tam\", \"given\": \"Doan Thi Hong\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Kraemer\", \"given\": \"Frank Alexander\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Telenor\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This thesis studies the SPACE method by creating building blocks for a Push to Talk (PTT)service in WLAN environment.

The existing heterogeneity makes it very costly to gather data from multiple buildings, thus making it difficult to understand the big picture.Facility managers cannot fix what they cannot see; thus it is important to facilitate the visualization of the data collected from all of the different building automation systems.

The study begins with a literature study to find previous and on-going attempts to solve this problem. Some initiatives for standardization of semantic models were found. Two of these models, Brick and Haystack, were chosen. One building automation system (BAS) was tested in a pilot case study, to test the appropriateness of a solution.The key results from this thesis project show that data from building automation systems, can be integrated into an analysis platform, and an extract, transform, and load (ETL) process for this is presented.

The thesis presents an approach to evaluate performance testing tools concerning requirements from the business domain and the system under test. This approach consists of a user study conducted with four quality assurance experts discussing general performance metrics and specific analytical needs. The outcome of the user study provided the assessment metrics for a comparative experimental evaluation of three open-source performance testing tools (JMeter, Locust, and Gatling) with a realistic test scenario. These three tools were evaluated in terms of their affordance and limitations in presenting analytical details of performance metrics, efficiency of load generation, and ability to implement realistic load models. The research shows that the user study with potential tool users provided a clear direction when evaluating the usability of the three tools. Additionally, the realistic test case was sufficient to reveal each tool\\u2019s capability to achieve the same scale of performance as the Nasdaq\\u2019s in-house testing tool OMEXUS and provide additional value with realistic simulation of user population and user behavior during performance testing with regard to the specified requirements.\\u00a0\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-302650\", \"number-of-pages\": \"81\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2021:512\", \"keyword\": \"Performance testing; Performance engineering; Information visualization; Quality assurance; User experience; Web services; Prestandatestning; Performance Testing; Prestandateknik; Performance Engineering; Informationsvisualisering; Kvalitetss\\u00e4kring; Quality assurance; Anv\\u00e4ndarupplevelse; Webbtj\\u00e4nster\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2021-09-29T14:33:15.582+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2021-09-28T14:20:41.226+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-25T10:47:03.577+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-302650\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 81.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:530384\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"Comparing Expected and Real\\u2013Time Spotify Service Topology\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Visockas\", \"given\": \"Vilius\", \"localId\": \"u1yq3juv\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Jiang\", \"given\": \"Yuming\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"NTNU Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Department of telematics, Trondheim, Norway\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Jansson\", \"given\": \"Mattias\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Spotify AB, Stockholm, Sweden\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Spotify is a music streaming service that allows users to listen to their favourite music. Due to the rapid growth in the number of users, the amount of processing that must be provided by the company\\u2019s data centers is also growing. This growth in the data centers is necessary, despite the fact that much of the music content is actually sourced by other users based on a peer-to-peer model.\\nSpotify\\u2019s backend (the infrastructure that Spotify operates to provide their music streaming service) consists of a number of different services, such as track search, storage, and others. As this infrastructure grows, some service may behave not as expected. Therefore it is important not only for Spotify\\u2019s operations (footnote: Also known as the Service Reliability Engineers Team (SRE)) team, but also for developers, to understand exactly how the various services are actually communicating. The problem is challenging because of the scale of the backend network and its rate of growth. In addition, the company aims to grow and expects to expand both the number of users and the amount of content that is available. A steadily increasing feature-set and support of additional platforms adds to the complexity. Another major challenge is to create tools which are useful to the operations team by providing information in a readily comprehensible way and hopefully integrating these tools into their daily routine. The ultimate goal is to design, develop, implement, and evaluate a tool which would help the operations team (and developers) to understand the behavior of the services that are deployed on Spotify\\u2019s backend network.\\nThe most critical information is to alert the operations staff when services are not operating as expected. Because different services are deployed on different servers the communication between these services is reflected in the network communication between these servers. In order to understand how the services are behaving when there are potentially many thousands of servers we will look for the patterns in the topology of this communication, rather than looking at the individual servers. This thesis describes the tools that successfully extract these patterns in the topology and compares them to the expected behavior.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-96352\", \"number-of-pages\": \"63\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:63\", \"keyword\": \"Spotify; services; topology; graph; dependencies; coorelation; service behavior; NetFlow; observing network; traffic analysis\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-14T14:15:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-01T18:29:40.755+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:21:50.411+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-96352\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 63.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:908334\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2016]]}, \"title\": \"Comparison of Methods of Single Sign-On : Post authentication methods in single sign on\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Topal\", \"given\": \"Baran\", \"localId\": \"u19rvcgk\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Hammarstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Kent Saxin\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Tacton Systems\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Single sign-on (SSO) is a session verification mechanism that allows a client to use a single password and name combination to be able to access multiple applications. The mechanism validates the client for all the applications and eliminates the need for authentication prompts when a user switches between applications within a session.SSO mechanisms can be classified as software versus hardware or customer-requirements oriented versus server-side arrangements. The five commonly used mechanisms of Single Sign-On currently are: Web Single Sign-On, Enterprise Single Sign-On, Kerberos (or Ticket/Token Authentication), Open ID, and Federation or Federated Identity.SSO has the main benefit of allowing a user to access many different systems without having to log on to each and every one of them separately. However, SSO introduces a security risk as once an attacker gains access to a single system, then the attacker has access to all of the systems.This thesis describes SSO technology, the Security Assertion Markup Language, and the advantages and risks involved in using SSO. It examines authentication mechanisms and their suitability for SSO integration. The main emphasis is a description of a mechanism that ameliorates some of the disadvantages of SSO by monitoring the user behavior with respect to a template. If a user performs actions that fit the defined template behavior, then the post authentication mechanism will not get activated. If, on the other hand, a user does something unforeseen, the mechanism will not perform authentication for this user, but rather trigger manual authentication. If this manual authentication succeeds, then the user will continue to interact with the system, otherwise user session will be ended.This behavior extension authentication mechanism is a method that eases the authentication process in which users are not expected to remember any username and password that can be forgotten easily or have a biometric attribute that can change over time. This method can be integrated to existing web application without a major risk and increase in cost.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-183144\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xvi,117\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2016:14\", \"keyword\": \"SSO; Single sign-on; SAML; authentication; security; behavior; risk; SSO; Single sign-on; SAML; autentisering; s\\u00e4kerhet; beteende; risk\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2016-03-08T16:22:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2016-03-01T17:31:32.522+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T10:02:08.869+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-183144\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 133.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:515387\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2002]]}, \"title\": \"Configuration of a DTM switch\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Liu\", \"given\": \"Jian\", \"localId\": \"u11xiwl2\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6455\", \"name\": \"KTH, Elektroniksystemkonstruktion\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6215\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"DTM, Dynamic synchronous Transfer Mode is a synchronous network protocol based on fast circuit switching.

Furthermore, non-blocking, time division switches with fully connected input ports and output ports exist today. This document presents a switch architecture designed for DTM networks. The switch is a time-space-time synchronous switch. Whole frames of data are mapped from input buffers to output buffers according to slot map tables.

This thesis focuses on the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS) and the Digitala vetenskapliga arkive (DiVA) as examples of separate silos.The thesis presents several methods of automating document handling associated with a degree project. It exploits the fact that students will submit their thesis to their examiner via Canvas. Canvas is the LMS platform used by students to submit all their coursework. When the examiner approves the thesis, it will be archived in DiVA and optionally published on DiVA. DiVA is an institutional repository used for research publications and student theses.When manually archiving and publishing student theses on DiVA several fields need to be filled in. These fields provide meta data for the thesis itself. The content of these fields (author, title, keywords, abstract, \\u2026) can be used when searching via the DiVA portal. It might not seem like a massive task to enter this meta data for an individual thesis; however, given the number of theses that are submitted every year, this process takes a large amount of time and effort. Moreover, it is important to enter this data correctly, which is difficult when manually doing this task. Therefore, this thesis project seeks to automate this process for future theses.The proposed solution parses PDF documents and uses information from the LMS in order to automatically generate a cover for the thesis and fill in the required DiVA meta data. Additionally, information for inserting an announcement of the student's oral thesis presentation into a calendar system will be provided. Moreover, the data in each case will be checked for correctness and consistency.Manually filling in DiVA fields in order to publish theses has been a quite demanding and time-consuming process. Thus, there is often a delay before a thesis is published on DiVA. Therefore, this thesis project\\u2019s goal is to provide KTH with an automated means to handle thesis archiving and publication on DiVA, while doing so more efficiently, and with fewer errors. The correctness of the extracted meta data will be evaluated by comparing the results to the previously entered meta data for theses that have previously been achieved in DiVA. The automated process has been calculated to take roughly 50 seconds to prepare the information needed to publish a thesis to DiVA with ~71% accuracy, compared with 1 hour and 34% accuracy in the previous manual method.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-230996\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,101\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2018:164\", \"keyword\": \"RESTful APIs; Canvas; DiVA; Calendar announcement; data mining; RESTful APIs; Canvas; DiVA; kalendrar; data mining\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-06-20T08:30:04.345+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-06-19T17:06:36.401+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T20:30:52.013+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-230996\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 114.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:536302\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1995]]}, \"title\": \"Construction and Implementation of a Walkstation Mobile-distributed File System Testbed\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Blomberg\", \"given\": \"Patrik\", \"localId\": \"u1o2bt2k\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"In this Master's Thesis an investigation, design and implementation of an object-oriented prototype of a new kind of client-agent-server based distributed file system, suited for wireless mobile computing, are presented. An overview is given of the characteristics and the inherent problems of mobile-wireless computing. Some solutions and techniques to reduce the effects of these problems are described. A presentation of a project (the Walkstation project) that tries to solve these problems is also given. Software to support a mobile-distributed file system is designed and implemented. Various software development techniques and mobile file system design solutions are proposed, and used in the implementation. An integrated caching and prefetching scheme with dynamically loadable cache and prefetch manager objects is designed and implemented. It is proposed that different cache and prefetch algorithms should be used for different kinds of network links. A cache/prefetch-manager object architecture with automatically location-dependant dynamical swapping of network specific manager objects at run-time is therefore proposed and implemented. A mechanism is designed with which an application optionally can be mobility-aware by subscribing for network-change events. Finally, an expedient example of a methodology to achieve easy-understandable and well-designed code, and good extensibility possibilities is explained and used in the development. This is done by utilizing an object-oriented software development methodology in the entire software development cycle.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98238\", \"number-of-pages\": null, \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-26T07:50:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-20T15:48:05.830+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:09:08.667+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98238\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 0.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1252694\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2018]]}, \"title\": \"Container overhead in microservice systems\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Fri\\u00f0riksson\", \"given\": \"Vilhelm\", \"localId\": \"u1r83wjq\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879654\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Containers have been gaining popularity in recent years due to their ability to provide higher flexibility, higher reliability and dynamic scalability to enterprise software systems. In order to fully utilize containers, software developers aim to build their software using microservice architecture, meaning that instead of working on a single large codebase for the whole project, the software is split into smaller units. These microservices can be deployed in their own container instead of the traditional virtual machine setup where a server has to configured with all necessary dependencies. Moving away from the monolithic software architecture to containerized microservices is bound to bring performance penalties due to increased network calls between services and container overhead. The integration must therefor be carefully planned in order to fully utilize the container setup while minimizing the overhead. The purpose of this thesis project was to measure how much overhead can be expected due to containers in an enterprise environment. By using a combination of virtual machines and Docker containers, a microservice system was deployed with four different deployment strategies and the system\\u2019s performance was measured by analyzing request response times under various loads. The services were made to run on a single server and on multiple servers, with and without Docker. The performance measurements showed that the system performed worse in every case when Docker was used. Furthermore, the results showed that Docker can have significant negative impact on performance when there is a heavy load on the system.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-235693\", \"number-of-pages\": \"x,62\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2018:599\", \"keyword\": \"Microservices; Containers; Docker; Virtual machines; Cloud computing; Mikroservices; Containers; Docker; Virtuella maskiner; Molntj\\u00e4nster\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-10-03T06:52:06.533+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-10-02T14:07:33.863+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T19:07:23.143+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-235693\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 72.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:521359\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"Content Aware Mobile Email Services\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Hjelm\\u00e9r\", \"given\": \"Johan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Eriksson\", \"given\": \"Henrik\", \"localId\": \"u1t80d6d\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Willehadson\", \"given\": \"Stefan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \" Ericsson Research\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The use and importance of email has increased tremendously over the past few years. Internet users are also becoming increasingly mobile and there has been a recent explosion in the market for small, hand-held Internet connected devices. Email has been identified as a \\u201ckiller application\\u201d for these devices and the race between hardware manufacturers, software houses and service providers to meet the email needs of mobile consumers is on.\\nMeanwhile the use of attachments in email messages has increased and these attachments are becoming more complex, thus requiring more bandwidth. They also often contain graphics such as images and video.\\nThe new small email enabled devices typically have small black and white screens, slow processors and little local storage, i.e. they are not very well suited for downloading and reading email attachments. We therefore propose adding content awareness to email services. By this we mean that email content is adapted to better suit the client before it is downloaded.We have identified two types of adaptions which are applicable: stripping (removing attachments from an email) and thinning (reduction of attachment size).\\nWe have looked at different ways of adding content awareness to an email service. We have implemented an agent based solution which uses multiple inboxes. We chose to call the solution MMAA (Mobile Mail Adaption Agent). The MMAA system is built around a standard IMAP server, a standard IMAP client and a personal Java agent. We have designed, implemented and evaluated the MMAA from a usability and security point of view. It works well, the main objection is that users tend to get confused by the idea of having more than one inbox.\\nWe have also examined the underlying email protocols IMAP and SMTP and suggested an addition to the IMAP protocol which would make it easier to implement future content aware email services. The extension adds a command to IMAP4rev1 called ADAPT. The ADAPT command lets clients communicate their characteristics to the server while fetching mail. The server can then content adapt the mail message according to these characteristics before delivering it to the client. The ADAPT extension has resulted in an Internet draft which can be found in Appendix C of this paper.\\nWhen we analysed the ADAPT extension and compared it to the agent based approach we found that the difference in download time is rather small and we have identified some improvements that could be made. Our conclusion is that the ADAPT extension is definetly the best way to add content awareness to a mobile email service.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93734\", \"number-of-pages\": \"70\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-20T14:14:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-24T17:23:09.537+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:46:51.010+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93734\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 70.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:575001\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"Content Based Addressing : The case for multiple Internet service providers\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"M\\u00f6rt\", \"given\": \"Robert\", \"localId\": \"u1zl0c5j\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Today's Internet usage is changing from host-to-host communication to user-to-content interaction which proves a challenge for Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Repeated requests lead to transfers of large amounts of traffic containing the same content often over costly inter-ISP connections. Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) contribute to solving this issue, but do not directly address the problem. This thesis project explores how content based addressing could minimize inter-ISP traffic due to repeated requests for content by caching content within the ISP's network. We implemented CCNx 0.6.0 in a network testbed in order to simulate scenarios with multiple ISPs interconnected to each other. This testbed is used to illustrate how caching of popular content minimizes inter-ISP traffic as well as how content independence minimizes the effect of other network problems such as link failures and congestion. These tests shows that the large overhead of the CCNx implementation due to the additional headers brings a 16% performance reduction compared to Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) transfers. However, these tests also shows that the cost from the inter-ISP traffic of CCNx transfers are constant regardless of the number of repeated requests, due to content caching in the ISP's network. As soon as there is more than one request for the same content there is a gain in using CCNx rather than HTTP for content transfer.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-107174\", \"number-of-pages\": \"27\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012-300\", \"keyword\": \"content based addressing; CCNx; content caching; inter-ISP traffic\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-12-10T10:40:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-12-07T10:24:13.068+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T02:12:04.417+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-107174\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 27.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:513165\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2005]]}, \"title\": \"Context Aware and Adaptive Mobile Audio\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Rangel Vacas\", \"given\": \"Inmaculada\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}, {\"id\": \"6016\", \"name\": \"KTH, KTH Center f\\u00f6r Tr\\u00e5dl\\u00f6sa System, Wireless@kth\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Today a large percentage of the population uses a handheld (either a mobile phone or a PDA) a laptop computer, or some other computing device. As this penetration increases, the user wants to take as great an advantage of these devices as possible. It is for that reason that communication is demanded almost everywhere. Simply having continuous access to the network is no longer sufficient thus context awareness and easy accessibility are becoming more and more relevant.The idea of this masters thesis is to explore these ideas building on the prior work of Maria Jos\\u00e9 Paraj\\u00f3n Dom\\u00ednguez. The devices used for this study will be an HP iPAQ h5550 and a laptop. A client-server application, whose components will be explained in detail in further sections, was designed to study some factors that may be taken into account when trying to satisfy the users\\u00b4 demands as stated above. One of these factors could be, for example, what are the effects of having a personal voice interface on the traffic to and from the user\\u2019s mobile device. The aim of this voice interface will be to provide more freedom to the user and also satisfy the demand for greater accessibility and facilitate mobile usage, not only for the common user, but also for handicapped people. Regarding the user\\u2019s desire to always have connectivity everywhere, we wish to examine the effects on the traffic to and from the user\\u2019s handheld, when exploiting significant local storage. Also related to the requirements on current devices to be always and everywhere connected and the huge amount of resources that this entails, it will be of interest to study the possibility of exchanging personalized CODECs (in the extreme case exchanging voice synthesis modules) and how this might affect traffic to and from the user\\u2019s mobile device. This last method could potentially greatly reducing both the demands on the communication links and the cost of this connectivity.With all these ideas in mind, this thesis aims to research an area that is nowadays continuously attracting new users and the goal is to find solutions to the demands that have resulted for these trends.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92291\", \"number-of-pages\": \"54\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-IMIT-LCN.

To be able to reach the devices in the PAN from outside in a simple manner, some location independent form of addressing may be used. One attractive approach is to use Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). For a user anywhere in the Internet, SIP enables them to reach a user within this PAN by an address that does not depend on where the user is located. To make life more convenient for the callee, the selection of device for an incoming multimedia invitation can be made automatically, by utilizing context information when selecting the device.\\nConsequently, a method is needed for allocating services to the devices that are most suitable for the service and for the moment. The current context in the PAN will affect this decision. This context information includes current status and capabilities of devices, the user, and their surroundings. The environment of a PAN is dynamic and thus this context information may change. This knowledge has to be reflected in the service allocation. This thesis will investigate and propose a method for how this service allocation is best performed.\\nTo be able to investigate this problem and develop a suitable method, knowledge in several areas is needed.

In order to fully enable context-awareness, a clear model for how to sense, manage, derive, store, and exchange context information must be defined. This will then provide the platform needed to enable development of context-aware applications that can exploit the possibilities of context-aware computing. The model must take into consideration parameters such as memory usage and power and bandwidth consumption, in order to be efficient on all types of platforms and in all types of networks. It must also be modular enough to survive replacing and upgrading of internal parts.\\nToday little research is available about sensing context information, sensor management, APIs towards other applications, and how and how often to present context information to applications. Since context aware computing relies heavily on the ability to obtain and represent context information, sensing strategies greatly affect efficiency and performance. It is therefore of great interest to develop and evaluate models for carrying out these tasks in order to exploit the results of context awareness research. This thesis will identify and design several components of such a model, as well as test and evaluate the design, in order to be able to make conclusions to whether is lives up to the expectations stated.\\nIn order to make the proper design decisions, a full understanding of the context-awareness research area and the goals and purposes of context-aware computing are required. To understand the entire picture is crucial to find a suitable solution. Therefore, determining an efficient sensor input and management strategy, along with a powerful and flexible API for applications, which are the goals of this thesis, fully qualifies as a significant master thesis assignment.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93116\", \"number-of-pages\": \"41\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": \"Context-aware; wearable devices\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-13T08:33:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-11T17:23:08.679+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:58:04.057+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93116\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 41.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:540740\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"Control traffic overhead for VoIP over LTE\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Salari\", \"given\": \"Syed Ghazanfar\", \"localId\": \"u1h93whd\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"M\\u00fchleisen\", \"given\": \"Maciej\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"ComNets, RWTH Aachen University, Germany\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"With increasing technological advancements more sophisticated mobile devices are being used by end-users. Third generation (3G) mobile communication systems such as Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) are not able to satisfy the rising demand for higher throughputs and low latencies. New standards based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), have been proposed and are currently being integrated into existing mobile networks all over the world.LTE specifications are being finalized within the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) with the ambitious goals of increased spectral efficiency and end user throughput. Despite the introduction of several high data rate services, voice communication is still an essential part of the overall wireless wide area cellular communication market. In LTE, the core network is purely packet switched, thus voice is transmitted entirely using a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). Like its predecessor standards it is desired that a large number of simultaneous VoIP calls be supported in LTE, while satisfying the desired Quality of Service (QoS) demands.This thesis examines issues related to VoIP capacity for LTE. One of the key challenges is the limited number of schedulable voice packets per sub frame. The main goal of this thesis is to quantify the impact of this limitation. After describing basic LTE concepts, a detailed description of the control channel resource limitations for the scheduling of voice packets is presented. Consequences of these limitations are explained systematically by presenting the problem in a wider context.Simulation results were obtained using the openWNS Simulator, an event driven system level simulation platform developed at the Communication Networks Research Group (ComNets), RWTH Aachen University Germany. Results are presented showing the impact of different scheduling strategies on VoIP capacity. These results illustrate how the limited control channel resources, specifically the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) resources, affect the total number of schedulable VoIP user audio media streams.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-99045\", \"number-of-pages\": \"57\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:65\", \"keyword\": \"LTE; VoIP capacity; Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH); Control Channel Elements (CCE); indoor hotspot; scheduling concepts; openWNS simulator; performance evaluation\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-07-31T08:51:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-07-11T10:50:04.744+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T03:59:42.203+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-99045\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 57.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1095403\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2017]]}, \"title\": \"Conversion Rate Optimization of E-Commerce using Web Analytics and Human-computer Interaction Principles : An in-depth Quantitative Approach to Optimization of Conversion Rates\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Kaushik\", \"given\": \"Utsav\", \"localId\": \"u1frp6cv\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Grondowski\", \"given\": \"Antonio\", \"localId\": \"u1im51e5\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"For an e-commerce business to grow, there are many ways one could try to improve the business in order to gain greater reach and increase sales. One of the main goals of such businesses is to convert as many visitors as possible into customers. Even though many e-commerce businesses already have web analytics tools installed, e-merchants find difficulty in identifying where to start optimizing, what data to extract from analysis reports, and how to make use of such data in order to produce a successful design that will increase the conversion rate. The purpose of this thesis is to (without spending resources on marketing-related factors) guide companies to find a low cost and efficient way to increase the conversion rate by creating well-thought-through designs based on analytic data, qualitative research, and human-computer interaction principles.Google Analytics, a web analytics tool, was used in identifying high-valued pages to optimize and to identify demographics/target groups, while qualitative e-commerce related research was used to shape design-proposal hypotheses. This, along with two A/B tests conducted using Optimizely, is the basis for the guidelines and conclusions.The results of both A/B tests showed an increase in conversions with designs highlighting: evidence of a secure shopping environment, incentives that will attract visitors to buy, and by removing auxiliary navigation elements at the check-out page. The evaluation of the results and its statistical significance was done using both Optimizely\\u2019s statistical engine and null hypothesis testing. The increases in conversions were not statistically significant per Optimizely; however, they were significant using traditional statistics.In conclusion, using metrics such as high exit-rates combined with many page views and high revenue-generating pages will allow e-merchants to identify where to start their optimization process. Furthermore, to know what valuable data needs to be extracted, one should seek the data that needs to be inserted into HCI concepts, such as personas and scenarios. This, along with qualitative research allows designers to create well-thought out design-proposals that will potentially lead to an increased conversion rate.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-207040\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xv,73\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2017:36\", \"keyword\": \"Conversion rate optimization; A/B testing; E-commerce; Quantitative Research; Interaction Design; Human-computer interaction; HCI; Web Design; Statistical Inference; Web Analytics.; Konverteringsoptimering; A/B-testning; e-handel; kvantitativ studie; interaktionsdesign; m\\u00e4nniska-datorinteraktion; MDI; webbdesign; statistisk inferens; webbanalys\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-05-15T12:54:42.544+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-05-13T13:21:06.399+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-27T02:07:21.881+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-207040\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 88.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:513064\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2005]]}, \"title\": \"Corporate Wireless IP Telephony\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Garc\\u00eda Hijes\", \"given\": \"Ra\\u00fal\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"IP telephony is defined as the transport of telephony calls over an IP network.

A range of technologies exist which allow GPUs to be used for general-purpose programming, NVIDIA\\u2019s CUDA platform is one example. CUDA makes it possible to combine source code written for GPUs and Central Processing Units (CPUs) in the same program. Those sections that benefit from parallel execution can be written as CUDA kernels and will be executed on the GPU. With CUDA it is common to have tens, or even hundreds, of thousands of threads running in parallel. While the high level of parallelism can offer significant performance increases for executed programs, it can also make CUDA programs hard to debug. Although debuggers for CUDA exist, they can not be used in the same way as standard debuggers, and they do not reduce the difficulties of reasoning about parallel execution. As a result, developers may feel compelled to fall back to inefficient debugging methods, such as relying on print statements. This project examines two possible approaches for creating a tool which simplifies the process of debugging CUDA programs, by transforming a parallel CUDA program to a sequential program in another high level language: one method centered around the Clang Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and the other method centered around LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) code. The method using Clang was found to be the most suitable for the purpose of translating CUDA, as it enables modifying only select parts, such as kernels, of the input program. Thus, the tool Cumulus was developed as a Clang plugin. Cumulus translates parallel CUDA code into sequential C++ code, allowing developers to use any method available for C++ debugging to debug their CUDA program. Cumulus is indicated to be a potential aid in debugging CUDA programs, by providing developers with increased flexibility.\\u00a0\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-304503\", \"number-of-pages\": \"89\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2021:637\", \"keyword\": \"Clang; Code generation; CUDA; Debugging; Parallel computing; Clang; Kodgenerering; CUDA; Fels\\u00f6kning; Parallella ber\\u00e4kningar\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2021-11-08T08:33:44.805+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2021-11-05T09:56:01.030+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-25T10:14:10.485+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-304503\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 89.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511403\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2008]]}, \"title\": \"Daedalus: A media agnostic peer-to-peer architecture for IPTV distribution\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Makris\", \"given\": \"Athanasios\", \"localId\": \"u1fs9frf\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Strikos\", \"given\": \"Andreas\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Ljunggren\", \"given\": \"Andreas\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"IPTV is gaining increasing attention.

To avoid these limitations C. Filippidis, C. Markou, and Y. Cotronis proposed the IKAROS framework.In this thesis project, the capabilities of the publicly available elastic-transfer (eT) module which was directly derived from the IKAROS, will be expanded.The eT uses Google\\u2019s Gmail service as an utility for efficient meta-data management. Gmail is based on the IMAP protocol, and the existing version of the eT framework implements the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) client-server connection through the \\u2018\\u2018Inbox\\u2019\\u2019 module from the Node Package Manager (NPM) of the Node.js programming language. This module was used as a proof of concept, but in a production environment this implementation undermines the system\\u2019s scalability and there is an inefficient allocation of the system\\u2019s resources when a large number of concurrent requests arrive at the eT\\u2032s meta-data server (MDS) at the same time. This thesis solves this problem by adopting an asynchronous non-blocking event driven approach to implement the IMAP client-server connection.

Additionally, the device may have various input and output devices, thus leading to people utilizing different devices for different use cases. In order to provide the latest information to the users via any of their devices, data synchronization becomes a requirement for users.\\nThere are many data synchronization solutions for synchronizing database records and files. In the current database synchronization solutions, there is no clear source and target. For example, consider the case where a PDA synchronizes with a PC; the record could have been edited (changed) on both the PDA and PC. In this case it is not clear which should be synchronized with what should be the source for the value. In contrast, a files synchronization system has a clearly specified synchronizatiom sourse and destination structure. In this case the client Synchronizes their files with that of the server. In a version control system the client synchronize files with a repository acting as a version control server. There are many synchronizing protocols and each has been designed for different purpose. Protocols for synchronizing database records often provide continuous synchronization, leading to a lot of data being exchanging during the synchronization process, as a result the synchronization process takes a longer period of time, but maintains the semantics of the database updates (either a complete transaction completes or it must be rolled back). On the other hand, protocols for synchronizing files may require a short synchronization time, as the whole file transferred and replaces the previous version of the file at the destination. Note file synchronization may also transfer only the differences between the files, with a local transformation of an existing file copy of the by applying these differences as updates to the files. Sending only the updates to a file enables large files with a small number of changes to be quickly updated. However, file based updated does not efficiently support record level updates of a database.\\nIn this thesis we designed a new synchronization protocol for synchronizing two SQLite databases. This synchronization protocol borrows from (and hence offers the advantages of) a version control system in order to rapidly perform SQLite database synchronization. Moreover, this solution brings SQLite database additional functions, for example supporting multiple-user, transaction logs, and data roll-back.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-46712\", \"number-of-pages\": \"75\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"88\", \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-11-04T13:00:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-11-04T12:59:13.742+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T20:40:26.744+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-46712\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 75.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:456523\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2011]]}, \"title\": \"Decentralized Authentication in OpenStack Nova : Integration of OpenID\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Khan\", \"given\": \"Rasib Hassan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The evolution of cloud computing is driving the next generation of internet services.

Usually, there are several emitters transmitting radar pulses at the same time in an environment.

The selected approach analyzes batches of pulses in parallel to exploit the advantages of a multi-threaded\\u00a0Central Processing Unit (CPU) or a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).\\u00a0Firstly, a suitable clustering algorithm had to be selected. Secondly, an optimal batch size had to be determined to achieve high clustering performance and to rapidly process the batches of pulses in parallel. A quantitative method based on experiments was used to measure clustering performance, execution time, system response, and parallelism as a function of batch sizes when using the selected clustering algorithm.The algorithm selected for clustering the data was Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)\\u00a0because of its advantages, such as not having to specify the number of clusters in advance, its ability to find arbitrary shapes of a cluster in a data set, and its low time complexity. The evaluation showed that implementing parallel batch processing is possible while still achieving high clustering performance, compared to a sequential implementation that used the maximum likelihood method.An optimal batch size in terms of data points and cutoff time is hard to determine since the batch size is very dependent on the input data. Therefore, one batch size might not be optimal in terms of clustering performance and system response for all streams of data. A solution could be to determine optimal batch sizes in advance for different streams of data, then adapt a batch size depending on the stream of data.However, with a high level of parallelism, an additional delay is introduced that depends on the difference between the time it takes to collect data points into a batch and the time it takes to process the batch, thus the system will be slower to output its result for a given batch compared to a sequential system. For a time-critical system, a high level of parallelism might be unsuitable since it leads to slower response times.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-273737\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xvi,57\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2020:178\", \"keyword\": \"Cluster analysis; DBSCAN; Parallelization; Signal Separation; Unsupervised learning; Klusteranalys; DBSCAN; Parallellisering; Signal Separation; O\\u00f6vervakat l\\u00e4rande\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2020-05-27T08:23:46.917+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2020-05-26T15:37:31.458+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T10:27:29.666+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-273737\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 73.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1692911\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2022]]}, \"title\": \"Deriving an Natural Language Processing inference Cost Model with Greenhouse Gas Accounting : Towards a sustainable usage of Machine Learning\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Axberg\", \"given\": \"Tom\", \"localId\": \"u1jnfm8d\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879223\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r elektroteknik och datavetenskap (EECS)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Gindele\", \"given\": \"Oliver\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Datatonic\"}]}, {\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"882650\", \"name\": \"KTH, Datavetenskap\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The interest in using State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Pre-Trained Language Model (PLM) in product development is growing.

By constructing this cost model and testing it against real-life examples, essential information about a given NLP implementation and the relationship between monetary and environmental costs will be derived.The literature studies reveal that the derival of a cost model is a complex area, and the results confirm that it is not a straightforward procedure to approximate energy costs.

Two aspects have been addressed: the selection of the algorithm to perform this matrix computation and the implementation of a highly parallel version of this algorithm.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-159474\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiv,64\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2015:4\", \"keyword\": \"channel estimation; MIMO detection; massive complex matrix inversion; SIMD; kanaluppskattning; MIMO-detektion; massiva komplex matrisinversion; SIMD\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-02-17T15:44:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-02-02T09:55:21.246+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T16:09:34.853+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-159474\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 78.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:536303\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1995]]}, \"title\": \"Design of a Multimedia Help System in UNIX\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Drugge\", \"given\": \"Fredrik\", \"localId\": \"u1ermf9a\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Andersson\", \"given\": \"Owe\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Utvecklings AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The department G at EUA has developed a project management method and tool, PROPS-N.

IMS is standardized by the 3GPP standardization forum, and was first released in 2002. Since then IMS has not had the wide adoption by operators as first anticipated. As 3G already supported voice and video, the operators could not justify the expense of IMS.The current emergence of the fourth generation mobile communication system named Long Term Evolution (LTE) has, however, increased the need for knowledge of IMS and of creating services for it. LTE networks are IP only networks that provide low latency. In order to use LTE for making phone calls, VoIP technologies are needed. IMS is the architecture intended to be used for Voice over LTE (VoLTE).The need for tools for education within IMS was seen in 2006 by Enea Experts in Link\\u00f6ping, Sweden. The author of this thesis designed an IMS for educational purposes, but the project was never fully completed.This thesis will reexamine the design decisions previously made by the author. The requirements stated by the customer remain: that an IMS with basic signaling and logging should be easy to install, maintain, and evolve at a low cost. A literature study of IMS and VoLTE is presented to contribute with knowledge in these areas. The previous design and implementation made by the author is presented and analyzed. The third-party software that the previous implementation was based on is reexamined. Existing open source components are analyzed in order to identify how they can be used to solve the problem and to identify what remains to be developed in order to fulfill the requirements. New design suggestions, presented in today\\u00b4s context, are proposed and verified using analytical reasoning and experiments.The outcome of the final work is new verified design decisions for the customer to use when implementing a new IMS for educational purposes.

While international roaming technically works with GSM, the cost of phone calls from one country to another are often much higher than calls within a country. Despite political pressure to reduce the costs of roaming within the European Union, the cost of phone calls from one country to another are often quite expensive. A cost-saving solution is eagerly desired by many firms. OptiCall Solutions AB has designed an integrated system called the Dial over Data (DoD) solution. In this scheme, a caller sends a data request to the DoD server instead of directly making a call to the party that they wish to speak with. The DoD solution uses an Internet Protocol Private Branch Exchange (IP-PBX) to make two Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) calls, one to the caller and another to the callee, then bridges these two calls. To realize cost savings, the cost of these two calls and the cost of the infrastructure necessary to make the two calls and to bridge them must be lower than the cost of the direct call.\\nCall Through is a service for making cheap international calls which is provided by many telecommunications companies. Instead of making a direct call to the party the caller wants to speak with, the caller makes a call to the local call-through service access number. The caller dials the actual callee\\u2019s number after the call is established. The service provider then makes a call to the callee and bridges the two calls. The caller only needs to pay for a local call and the service subscription fee, rather than the expensive international call fee. This can greatly reduce the costs for user who need to make a lot international calls. Today, many companies use such a call-through service in order to reduce the total cost of their employees\\u2019 calls.\\nAdditionally, the Mobile Extension (MEX) is a concept which gives mobile users the ability to use their mobile phone in the same manner as their fixed office phone, for example, by providing services such as setting presence and transferring a call. In addition, the user should experience a consistent interface, for example the calling number displayed for the callee should always be a number that the callee could use to return the call.\\nIn this thesis project, a mobile extension application called \\u2018OptiCaller\\u2019 based on the Symbian OS was developed and evaluated. This application is part of the DoD solution and provides client side functionality. Furthermore, it supports making call-through calls and using the MEX functions. Additionally, it is designed and implemented in a flexible way so that it can work with a variety of different PBX solutions.\\nA provisioning system called \\u2018OptiCaller Provisioning System\\u2019 was also designed and evaluated.

Personal information technology appliances have become part of our life, via cellular phones, PDAs, Bluetooth headsets, handheld keyboards, GPS, and digital cameras. In the future, new intelligent devices will be invented as technology evolves. However, because multiple devices provide similar (but different) functionality it is complex for the average user to choose a single device. Moreover, today it is hard to configure, administer, and use several different appliances together. In order to be utilized in an effective manner and in an accessible way, personal devices should be aggregated, i.e., connected together via a local area network so that they can appear to the user as if they were a single device.\\nThis paper introduces a connection model based on device aggregation to realize shared state, the behavior of a shared appliance, and with the superset of the individual device functionality. Such an aggregated logical device might even exhibit functions which a user would have a very hard time realizing by manually combining devices. This will facilitate the user\\u2019s control over their appliances (build of different devices), but acting as one device.\\nThe project was a joint effort with David Sabat\\u00e9 Mogica.

A successful DDoS attack that manages to penetrate a company\\u2019s network can lead to devastating damages in the form of lost income, reduced productivity, increase in costs, and damage to the company\\u2019s image and reputation.The different DDoS attacks are many and of different character and often Offer different parts of the network, which makes it very difficult to defend against. It is also very clear that DDoS attacks are increasing in both numbers and size every year. From our experiments we have proven that anyone with little knowledge and limited resources can perform DDoS attacks that will make a website unavailable. This fact should cause companies that base their business on the internet, aware that they are likely to someday be subject to a DDoS attack.From our research we have found a variety of different DDoS solutions on the market that promise to offer protection. Many of which claim to protect against all different types of DDoS attacks. In practice it is impossible to find something that guarantees 100% safety. According to earlier research in the field, there are many different ways of protecting a network against DDoS attacks, e.g. via Software Defined Networking, Hop-Count Filtering, or Kill-bots.Our own tests show that a virtual firewall can offer protection against DDoS attacks on a low scale, but that such a solution has a number of weaknesses. If the firewall does protect the website, the attacker could instead shift to attacking the firewall itself.Our research also shows that the most common motives behind DDoS attacks are criminal purposes. Criminals use DDoS attacks to earn money by offering directed DDoS attacks against websites or by trying to blackmail companies into paying a fee for not being attacked.We have also seen that the economic consequence of DDoS attacks are devastating if not handled with a sufficiently fast response. After investigating the e-commerce company CDON.com we learned that they could potentially lose roughly 36 410 SEK per minute when a DDoS attack is underway against them.In today\\u2019s business climate it is important for companies to be able to rely on the internet for their activity and for customers to have easy access to the company\\u2019s products and services.

Tools such as TITANSim are used to develop the test framework upon which a load test application is created. These tools need to be highly efficient and optimized to reduce the cost of the system test. This thesis project created a load test application based on the distributed scheduling architecture of TITANSim, whereby multiple users can be simulated using a single test component. This new distributed scheduling system greatly reduces the number of operating system processes involved, thus reducing the memory consumption of the load test application; hence higher loads can be easily simulated with limited hardware resources.The load test application used for system test of the HSS is based on the central scheduling architecture of TITANSim. The central scheduling architecture is a <i>function test </i>concept, where every user is simulated by a single test component. In the <i>system test </i>several thousand users are simulated by the test system. Therefore, the load application based on central scheduling architecture uses thousands of test components leading to high memory consumption in the test system. In this architecture, the scheduling of test components is centralized which results in a lot of communication overhead within the test system, as thousands of test components communicate with a <i>master scheduling </i>component during the test execution.On the other hand, in the distributed scheduling architecture the scheduling task is performed locally <i>by each test component. There is no communication overhead within the test system. </i>Therefore, the test system is highly efficient. In the distributed scheduling architecture the traffic flow of the simulated users are described using the Finite State Machines (FSMs). The FSMs are specified in the configuration files that are used by the test system at run time. Therefore, implementing traffic cases using the distributed scheduling architecture becomes simpler and faster as there is no (TTCN-3) coding/compilation.The HSS is the only node (within Ericsson) whose system test is performed using the central scheduling architecture of TITANSim. The other users (nodes) of TITANSim are using the distributed scheduling architecture for its apparent benefits. Under this circumstance, this thesis project assumes significance for the HSS. When a decision to adapt the distributed scheduling architecture is made for the system test of the HSS, the load application created in this thesis project can be used as a model, or extended for the migration of the test modules for the HSS from the central scheduling architecture to the distributed scheduling architecture.By creating this load application we have gained significant knowledge of the TITANSim framework; most importantly, the necessary modifications to the TITANSim framework required to create a distributed scheduling architecture based load application for the HSS. The load application created for this project was used to (system) test the HSS by generating load using real system test hardware. The results were analytically compared with the test results from the existing load application (which is based on the central scheduling architecture). The analysis showed that the load application based on distributed scheduling architecture is efficient, utilizes less test system resources, and capable of scaling up the load generation capacity\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-50066\", \"number-of-pages\": \"113\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2011:185\", \"keyword\": \"FSM; scheduling; system test; TITANSim; test components; FSM; schemal\\u00e4ggning; systemtest; TITANSim; testa komponenter\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-12-01T15:32:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-12-01T15:32:22.824+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T19:49:08.045+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-50066\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 113.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511401\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2008]]}, \"title\": \"Distribution of Context Information using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Angeles Pi\\u00f1a\", \"given\": \"Carlos\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Devlic\", \"given\": \"Alisa\", \"localId\": \"u102q432\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Appear Networks\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Context-aware applications are applications that exploit knowledge of the situation of the user (i.e. the user\\u2019s context) to adapt their behavior, thus helping the user achieve his or her daily tasks. Today, the transfer of context information needs to take place over unreliable and dynamically changing networks. Moreover context information may be produced in different devices connected to different networks. These difficulties have limited the development of context-aware applications. This thesis presents a context distribution method exploiting the event notification mechanisms of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), aiming to provide access to context information regardless of where it is produced.\\nThe context distribution component presented in this thesis uses SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE) to enable context sharing by using a SIP presence server, specifically the SIP Express Router (SER) and its presence module. This context distribution component allows distribution of context information in both synchronous and asynchronous mode. The distribution mode depends on the application requirements for context distribution, as well as the nature and characteristics of the contextinformation. In this thesis, based on system scalability, the user\\u2019s mobility, and latency - recommendations are given about in which situations each mode is more suitable for distributing context information.\\nThe system was evaluated using a load generator. The evaluation revealed that the server is highly scalable. The response time for synchronous retrieval of context information is nearly constant, while in asynchronous mode the time to process a subscription increases with the amount of information in the database regarding previous subscriptions. Notifications are sent at a regular rate (\\u22482800 notifications per second); however there is a purposely random delay (0 to 1 second), between an update of context information (i.e. receipt of a publish message) and the start of notifications to subscribed users.\\nThe requirements of the context-aware applications using the distribution component, such as response time, have to be taken into account when deciding upon the mode of context distribution for each application. This thesis provides some empirical data to help an application developer make this selection.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91854\", \"number-of-pages\": \"93\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2008-12\", \"keyword\": \"Context-awareness; Context Information Distribution; SIP; SIMPLE\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-21T12:45:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-21T12:42:40.926+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:16:54.365+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91854\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 93.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:602353\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2013]]}, \"title\": \"DNS prestanda\", \"language\": \"swe\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Bentahar\", \"given\": \"Younes\", \"localId\": \"u16iz6av\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Use of computers and computer networks is nowadays a part of everyday life. You do not use them only at home when you sit at you computer, but you can use them all the time everywhere. This can involve everything from surf to any website when you are at home, to checking your email on your mobile when you are on your way to work. Most people do not think about how it really works when they try to access a web page by typing the address into their browser, but something that most people probably notice is how long it can sometimes take to access a web page.All items which are directly connected to the IP network have a unique IP address that is used to make it possible to communicate. The IP address is either a period separated sequence of digits representing 32 bits or a colon separated sequence of digits representing 128 bits, depending on whether the address is an IPv4 or IPv6 address. Such numeric sequences are often difficult for us humans to remember therefore, the domain name system (DNS) was constructed. DNS makes it possible for us to write addresses in a textual format to access an item stored in a device connected to the network. DNS can be seen as a directory for the network and can be compared to a telephone directory, where if you know the name of a person can find his or her phone number.This thesis will describe how the various address translations are done by using DNS. It will also examine how much impact DNS has on the experienced delay from the time you type a web page address in the address bar of your browser to the actual time you reach the website. A survey of DNS performance will be presented to investigate how much delay can be reduced by using one of Sweden's two most well-known public DNS servers (Google Public DNS and OpenDNS) instead of the normal default DNS server provided by one's Internet service provider (ISP).The survey will also show how the DNS lookup waiting time changes at different times of day and different days of the week. The purpose of this work is to provide a basic explanation of what DNS is and increase the understanding of how an everyday user in a simple way can make their network usage more effective by getting their DNS lookups to occur faster.The conclusion from this thesis is that the alternative DNS server, Google Public DNS has the fastest DNS lookup time for this particular computer which the measurement was carried on. But this tells us nothing about whether the case for any other network users because the observed DNS performance has a large extent dependent on the ISP you are connected to, and what place you are at.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-117626\", \"number-of-pages\": \"24\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:2\", \"keyword\": \"DNS; DNSSEC; performance; measurements; Google Public DNS; OpenDNS; DNS; DNSSEC; prestanda; m\\u00e4tningar; Google Public DNS; OpenDNS\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-02-01T13:08:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-02-01T08:15:27.720+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T01:20:43.055+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-117626\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 24.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:524298\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"DNS Traffic Analysis for Network-based Malware Detection\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Vu Hong\", \"given\": \"Linh\", \"localId\": \"u1z96o6j\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Liljenstam\", \"given\": \"Michael\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Security Research\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Probst\", \"given\": \"Christian W.\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Technical University of Denmark (DTU)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Botnets are generally recognized as one of the most challenging threats on the Internet today. Botnets have been involved in many attacks targeting multinational organizations and even nationwide internet services. As more effective detection and mitigation approaches are proposed by security researchers, botnet developers are employing new techniques for evasion. It is not surprising that the Domain Name System (DNS) is abused by botnets for the purposes of evasion, because of the important role of DNS in the operation of the Internet. DNS provides a flexible mapping between domain names and IP addresses, thus botnets can exploit this dynamic mapping to mask the location of botnet controllers. Domain-flux and fast-flux (also known as IP-flux) are two emerging techniques which aim at exhausting the tracking and blacklisting effort of botnet defenders by rapidly changing the domain names or their associated IP addresses that are used by the botnet. In this thesis, we employ passive DNS analysis to develop an anomaly-based technique for detecting the presence of a domain-flux or fast- flux botnet in a network. To do this, we construct a lookup graph and a failure graph from captured DNS traffic and decompose these graphs into clusters which have a strong correlation between their domains, hosts, and IP addresses. DNS related features are extracted for each cluster and used as input to a classication module to identify the presence of a domain-flux or fast-flux botnet in the network. The experimental evaluation on captured traffic traces veried that the proposed technique successfully detected domain-flux botnets in the traces. The proposed technique complements other techniques for detecting botnets through traffic analysis.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93842\", \"number-of-pages\": \"67\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:53\", \"keyword\": \"DNS analysis; domain-flux; fast-flux; network-based malware detection; intrusion detection\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-05-04T08:04:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-30T18:42:03.806+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:45:05.409+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93842\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 67.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511400\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2008]]}, \"title\": \"Drift\\u00f6vervakning av Windows och Linux/Unix Servrar\", \"language\": \"swe\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Falk\", \"given\": \"Mikael\", \"localId\": \"u1ek693s\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Fernandez Karlsson\", \"given\": \"Matias\", \"localId\": \"u1xru1nu\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Ju fler servrar, med olika konfigurationer och olika system, som blir medlemmar i ett n\\u00e4tverk, desto sv\\u00e5rare och osmidigare blir det att \\u00f6vervaka n\\u00e4tverksmilj\\u00f6n.

Parking has been considered as a subsidiary activity to owning a car. However, these days owning a car has become the norm, which leads to a greater demand for parking. Unregulated parking demand often leads to increased traffic congestion, when there are not enough parking spaces to keep up with the demand. Congestion itself has a negative impact on the environment and causes safety issues. A common solution to reduce congestion have been by influencing the demand for parking spaces through parking prices. During recent years, the existing pricing strategies have not been able to keep up with the daily changes in demand. Therefore, stakeholders in the parking industry have started to shift towards working for dynamic pricing.Dynamic pricing utilizes a pricing strategy that sets the price according to the current demand and occupancy. However, the parking industry is missing a key feature to fully enable dynamic pricing. There is no communication standard in the parking industry. Thus, there is no efficient communication mean for the stakeholders to share their parking-related information (such as location, occupancy, and tariff data). This thesis has developed and proposes a protocol for sharing such parking-related information. The aim is that the protocol will be used as a communication standard in the parking industry. Due to limited time, the most focus was put on completing the protocol for tariff data. However, the developed protocol can be considered as a partial solution towards dynamic pricing. Because the protocol can still be used to properly share tariff data.Based on the evaluation, the protocol could express a variety of tariffs. The tariffs that are expressible have use cases such as early bird, residential, or on-street parking. To make integration easier, for the parking industry, the protocol includes tools to aid integrations of the protocol. A future work will be to complete the support of location and occupancy related data. Additionally, it has been discussed that the protocol will onwards be developed as open-source.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-229904\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,75\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2018:127\", \"keyword\": \"Data sharing; Dynamic pricing; Parking industry; Parking tariffs; Protocol; Datakommunikation; Dynamisk priss\\u00e4ttning; Parkeringsindustrin; Parkeringstariffer; Protokoll\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-06-12T09:03:20.606+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-06-08T12:53:09.971+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T20:44:25.576+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-229904\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 88.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:699823\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2014]]}, \"title\": \"Dynamic scaling of a web-based application in a Cloud Architecture\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Hossain\", \"given\": \"Md.

These unpredictable natures of the traffic have led to many new and unique challenges which must be addressed by solution architects, application developers, and technology researchers. All of these actors must continually innovate to create new attractive application and new system architectures to support the users of these new applications. In addition, increased traffic increases the demands for resources, while users demand even faster response times, despite the ever-growing datasets underlying many of these new applications.

The purpose of this thesis is to examine the benefits and possible shortcomings of using Microsoft Dynamics AX in the cloud, specifically Microsoft Azure, instead of using local datacenters. This thesis project has been done at Scania IT using their implementation of Dynamics AX.This thesis project consists of an extensive literature study regarding both ERP Systems as well as other systems in regards to the cloud. It was decided early on to focus on the new version of Dynamics AX, which currently is only available in the cloud and compare this implementation to the two versions that the majority are using today, AX 2009 and AX 2012. The benefits of AX and Azure both being Microsoft products are clear with the welldesigned integrations and support all the way through the clients to the servers regarding backups and load balancing. It is shown how the developers have to work differently in regards to integrations with outside systems, especially in regards to AX 2009 with the frameworks having changed. The addition of Data Entities mean that the developers can save a lot of time by only needing a reference to the location of the object in the database instead of having to keep track of all the tables themselves.The analysis focuses on the differences in four different areas, performance &amp; accessibility, scalability, cost savings as well as security &amp; privacy. The background knowledge that is being used for the analysis primarily comes from the literature study as well as knowledge gained by studying the implementation at Scania today. The result shows that there are clear advantages regarding performance, cost savings and especially accessibility, however it is also clear that laws in a lot of countries still have not caught up with the fact that it is possible to use the cloud for data storage these days. Which in turn means that the best move in the near future for the majority of ERP users would be either a hybrid or private cloud within the borders of the same country.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-196060\", \"number-of-pages\": \"56\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2016:145\", \"keyword\": \"Dynamics AX; Microsoft; ERP; Enterprise resource planning; Azure; Cloud; Dynamics AX; Microsoft; ERP; Enterprise Resource Planning; Azure; Molnet\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2016-11-11T10:08:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2016-11-11T10:08:24.757+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-27T04:44:29.499+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-196060\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 56.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:534662\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1996]]}, \"title\": \"E13 Mux : Study and prototyping\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Jonsson\", \"given\": \"Jonas\", \"localId\": \"u1k0u40y\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Strangert\", \"given\": \"Thomas\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Telecom AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Even though this thesis-project never reached the goal, a fully equipped and working prototype, it is possible to make a few important and valuable conclusions for further implementation of a prototype handling multiplexing and demultiplexing of timeslots in primary rate, E1 level and third rate, E3 level.\\nThis `stripped' prototype is designed to multiplex timeslots from two E1 links into one E3 link, demultiplex timeslots from one E3 link into to two E1 links, also detect and generate basic alarms such as AIS, RAI and Loss of Signal. It is equipped with one dualdirected E3 interface and a dualdirected interface for two DL-2 connections. DL-2 is an Ericsson internal format. A conversion from DL-2 to E1 is made on the board. Since there are only two actual DL-2 connections and the remaining fourteen connections simulates AIS when multiplexed and not taken care of when demultiplexed, the prototype is considered as `stripped'. The wired prototype is easily controlled from an ANSI terminal, through the V.24 interface. When prototyping is finished and the construction is installed in AXE-10 environment, the V.24 interface will be unnecessary. The reason is the command interpreter that the V.24 interface is built upon. A command interpreter is not needed in AXE-10 environment, since the multiplexer unit will be controlled by DEVCB-signals from a regional processor and not by user commands.\\nThe hardware is built up around the Motorola 68HC11F1. The multiplexors are very simple and are controlled by pins and not registers. This makes them easy to integrate in a system, but on the other hand it calls for higher performance of the device processor. The 68HC11F1 is not suitable for a fully equipped construction. The device processor must be able to handle alarms and produce statistics from a total of seventeen links, because the multiplexors doesn't support much more than a few alarm functions.\\nThe software is written with processes and signals using OS11 operative system. The software is mostly written in C. The tasks that the processes preforms are distinct and logically separated, and will not be a cause of concern when reading the programs.

It analyses the problems that have occurred and considers those that may arise. This thesis focuses mainly on economical and political perspectives, rather than the technical perspective used in most reports regarding this subject.\\nThere were four areas that needed to be examined: the technical basis for DNSSEC, the deployment process, the current level of DNSSEC deployment, and the opinions regarding this subject. The information about the deployment process was obtained mainly through articles, but also through reports from organizations such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and the Electronic Privacy Information Centre. To acquire up to date data on DNSSEC deployment, SecSpider was used to research the level of deployment as of 2010-05-06. The search was restricted to the generic Top Level Domains (gTLDs) and country code TLDs (ccTLDs) of the top 20 countries in terms of Internet usage as well as the OECD countries. This restriction was made to narrow down the scope to the TLDs where DNSSEC would have the greatest impact. The \\u201cTop 20\\u201d comprises 77.27 % of the world\\u2019s Internet users, hence it is where DNSSEC deployment would affect the most people. The OECD is in this thesis considered a sufficient ly large selection to represent themost technologically advanced and economically powerful countries in the world regardless of size. Major powers such as China, India, and Russia while not included in the OECD are represented in the \\u201cTop 20\\u201d due to their size.\\nOur results show that some major TLDs have implemented DNSSEC and that the rate of deployment has increased in the last few years. However, the level of DNSSEC deployment in the TLDs is still rather low; 15.00 % in the gTLDs and ccTLDs of the Top 20 countries in Internet usage, and 20.00 % in the OECD\\u2019s ccTLDs. Deployment in the root is ongoing during spring 2010, this could have a great impact on the rate of deployment as deployment in a gTLD or ccTLD is highly dependent on deployment high up in the hierarchy due to the nature of DNSSEC. It is unlikely that corporations would implement DNSSEC without a potential return on investment (ROI) and management control measures from governments might be required to increase deployment pace at the lower levels of the DNS hierarchy.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91103\", \"number-of-pages\": \"24\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"108\", \"keyword\": \"IPv6; Multicast; Proxying; Tunneling; Routing\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-08T09:42:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-07T16:30:55.466+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:30:22.794+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91103\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 24.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1597882\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2021]]}, \"title\": \"Efficient generation and rendering of tube geometry in Unreal Engine : Utilizing compute shaders for 3D line generation\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Woxler\", \"given\": \"Platon\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879223\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r elektroteknik och datavetenskap (EECS)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Lane\", \"given\": \"H\\u00e5kan\", \"localId\": \"u1xewqw3\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879223\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r elektroteknik och datavetenskap (EECS)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Massive graph visualization in an immersive environment, such as virtual reality (VR) or Augmented Reality (AR), has the possibility to improve users\\u2019 understanding when exploring data in new ways. To make the most of a visualization, such as this, requires interactive components that are fast enough to accommodate interactivity. By rendering the edges of the graph as shaded lines that imitate three\\u2011dimensional (3D) lines or tubes, one can circumvent technical limitations. This method works well enough when using traditional two\\u2011dimensional (2D) monitors, but representing tubes as flat lines in a virtual environment (VE) makes for a less immersive user experience as opposed to visualizing true 3D geometry. In order to accommodate for these requirements i.e., speed and visual fidelity, we need a time efficient way of producing tubular meshes. This thesis project explores how one can generate tubular geometry utilizing compute shaders in the modern game engine, Unreal Engine (UE). Exploiting the parallel computing power of the graphical processing unit (GPU) we use compute shaders to generate a tubular mesh following a predetermined path. The result from the project is an open source plugin for UE, able to generate tubular geometry at rapid rates. While not giving any major advantages when generating smaller models, comparing it to a sequential implementation, the compute shader implementation create and render models &gt; 40\\u00d7 faster when generating 10<sup>6</sup> tube segments. A secondary effect of generating most of the data on the GPU, is that we avoid bottlenecks that can occur when surpassing the bandwidth of the central processing unit (CPU) to GPU data transfer. Using this tool researches can more easily explore information visualization in a VE.

The major advantages of storing applications and documents in public cloud are lower cost through use of shared computing resources and no upfront infrastructure costs. However, in this case the management of data and other services is insecure. Therefore, security is a major problem in a public cloud as the cloud and the network are open to many other users. In order to provide security, it is necessary for data owners to store their data in the public cloud in a secure way and to use an appropriate access control scheme.Designing a computation and communication efficient key management scheme to selectively share documents based on fine-grained attribute-based access control policies in a public cloud is a challenging task. There are many existing approaches that encrypt documents prior to storage in the public cloud: These approaches use different keys and a public key cryptographic system to implement attribute-based encryption and/or proxy re-encryption. However, these approaches do not efficiently handle users joining and leaving the system when identity attributes and policies change. Moreover, these approaches require keeping multiple encrypted copies of the same documents, which has a high computational cost or incurs unnecessary storage costs. Therefore, this project focused on the design and development of an efficient key management scheme to allow the data owner to store data in a cloud service in a secure way. Additionally, the proposed approach enables cloud users to access the data stored in a cloud in a secure way.Many researchers have proposed key management schemes for wired and wireless networks. All of these existing key management schemes differ from the key management schemes proposed in this thesis. First, the key management scheme proposed in this thesis increases access level security. Second, the proposed key management scheme minimizes the computational complexity of the cloud users by performing only one mathematical operation to find the new group key that was computed earlier by the data owner. In addition, this proposed key management scheme is suitable for a cloud network. Third, the proposed key distribution and key management scheme utilizes privacy preserving methods, thus preserving the privacy of the user. Finally, a batch key updating algorithm (also called batch rekeying) has been proposed to reduce the number of rekeying operations required for performing batch leave or join operations. The key management scheme proposed in this thesis is designed to reduce the computation and communication complexity in all but a few cases, while increasing the security and privacy of the data.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-148048\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,57\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2014:107\", \"keyword\": \"Cloud storage; Secure Storage; Key Management scheme; access level security; Cloud Storage; s\\u00e4ker f\\u00f6rvaring; nyckelhantering schema; \\u00e5tkomstniv\\u00e5 s\\u00e4kerhet\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-08-05T15:51:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-07-18T17:58:09.896+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T19:18:04.969+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-148048\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 70.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:516963\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2000]]}, \"title\": \"Electronic payment and controlfunctions in the BESTYR project\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Karlsson\", \"given\": \"Ulrik\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Sundberg\", \"given\": \"Jonas\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Sweco VBB Viak\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This master thesis aims at developing to a demonstrate system for road-pricing.

In the next five years the number of smartphone subscriptions is expected to more than double, while the amount of mobile traffic per active subscription per month of these subscribers is expected to nearly quadruple.As a consequence, mobile network operators (MNOs) aim to increase radio network capacity and coverage through heterogeneous deployments. In such heterogeneous networks, wireless local area networks (WLANs) are integrated with wireless wide area networks (WWANs), and there exist a tight interaction between them.The almost-ubiquitous support for IEEE802.11 WLANs (usually referred to as Wi-Fi\\u00ae) makes this radio access technology a potential integrated component of near-future mobile broadband. With Wi-Fi completely integrated into mobile access, MNOs would optimize user experience and use of resources by controlling device\\u2019s choice of connectivity. In addition to guaranteeing the best user experience, optimal use of access networks should care about energy-efficiency in order to extend device\\u2019s battery life.However, the performance of Wi-Fi is far from meet neither energy-efficiency nor quality of service (QoS) user\\u2019s requirements. This radio access technology employs an energy-consuming medium access control (MAC) protocol that wastes both bandwidth and device\\u2019s energy resources. Therefore, enhanced MAC protocols, cleverly combined with standardized power saving mechanisms such as automatic power save delivery (APSD), would improve both energy-efficiency and QoS in order to enhance WLANs performance and meet user\\u2019s expectations.In addition, current WLAN discovery mechanisms neither meet requirements of the integrated scenario. Handover operations must be improved in terms of energy efficiency and latency. Consequently, enhanced handover schemes should reduce overall device\\u2019s energy consumption during the process, and enable seamless handover between Wi-Fi APs and between cellular/Wi-Fi networks.During this thesis project, the main challenges of Wi-Fi towards its integration into mobile access broadband have been analyzed.

On average each of these users transfers more than 450 Mbytes per month via either a cellular network or a Wi-Fi network. So far it has been up to the user to decide which one of these two networks to use at each particular moment.In this master\\u2019s thesis, the potential energy savings that could be achieved by means of automating the choice of network interface are explored. This way, the user equipment itself would be able to initiate handovers from one radio access technology to another depending on each particular service and on the environmental conditions, and hence it could extend its battery life.The work has focused in energy efficient vertical handovers (VHOs) between Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and Wi-Fi networks. The rapid growth and increasing interest in LTE networks have been the main reasons why these networks have been chosen over Third Generation Mobile Networks. Nevertheless this work can be easily extended to other radio access technologies such as WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) or UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System).During the thesis project, the potential energy savings via VHOs depending on the type of service have been studied, as well as the different processes involved in a handover decision process. In order to do so, an energy consumption profile of each interface has been built, the different services have been modeled, and a heterogeneous scenario with Wi-Fi and LTE networks has been simulated. The thesis presents how these savings change within each service and with the environmental conditions (network load, interferences).The results show that large energy savings can be achieved. Nevertheless, the potential savings for each different user device can significantly differ. The VHO decision process includes two main aspects that need further study: investigating energy efficient ways of discovering accessible Wi-Fi access points and measuring the available throughput in each network at the moment of the decision.In addition, within LTE-Advanced and HetNets (Heterogeneous Networks), a lot of research regarding how LTE operators can offload traffic to smaller networks is being performed. These smaller networks consist basically of LTE micro cells and Wi-Fi. Both the energy savings and the potential energy expenses of offloading different kinds of traffic to a Wi-Fi network were also studied in this master\\u2019s thesis project, using the same approach described in the previous two paragraphs.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-118760\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xv, 111\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:33\", \"keyword\": \"Vertical Handover; Offload; LTE; 4G; WLAN; Wi-Fi; Energy consumption; Energy savings; Energy-efficient; Handover; IEEE 802.11; Vertikal Handover; Avlastning; LTE; 4G; WLAN; Wi-Fi; Energif\\u00f6rbrukning; Energibesparingar; Energieffektiv; IEEE 802.11; Smartphone; Batteriets livsl\\u00e4ngd\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-02-26T12:58:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-02-26T10:47:50.451+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T01:05:39.963+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-118760\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 126.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:531930\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1997]]}, \"title\": \"Enhanced hand-off scheme in Mobile IP network\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Rosenbaum\", \"given\": \"Filip\", \"localId\": \"u1yfjv7b\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}, {\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Rassoulpour\", \"given\": \"Arash\", \"localId\": \"u1plcs6g\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Seneviratne\", \"given\": \"Aruna\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"University of Technology, Sydney (UTS)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Motion across wireless cell boundaries causes increased delays and packet losses when the network routes the packet to the host's new location.

IoT provides the potential to combine machine-to-machine (M2M) interaction and real time data collection within the field of manufacturing. Therefore, the adoption of IoT in industry enhances dynamic optimization, control and data-driven decision making. However, the domain suffers due to interoperability issues, with massive numbers of IoT devices connecting to the internet despite the absence of communication standards upon. Heterogeneity is pervasive in IoT ranging from the low levels (device connectivity, network connectivity, communication protocols) to high levels (services, applications, and platforms). The project investigates the current state of industrial IoT (IIoT) ecosystem, to draw a comprehensive understanding on interoperability challenges and current solutions in supporting of IoT-based smart manufacturing.Based upon a literature review, IIoT interoperability issues were classified into four levels: technical, syntactical, semantic, and organizational level interoperability. Regarding each level of interoperability, the current solutions that addressing interoperability were grouped and analyzed. Nine reference architectures were compared in the context of supporting industrial interoperability. Based on the analysis, interoperability research trends and challenges were identified.FIWARE Generic Enablers (FIWARE GEs) were identified as a possible solution in supporting interoperability for manufacturing applications. FIWARE GEs were evaluated with a scenario-based Method for Evaluating Middleware Architectures (MEMS).\\u00a0 Nine key scenarios were identified in order to evaluate the interoperability attribute of FIWARE GEs. A smart manufacturing use case was prototyped and a test bed adopting FIWARE Orion Context Broker as its main component was designed.

The data rates provided to the customers by their network providers vary from Mbps to Gbps. However, rarely do users get the promised peak throughput.In cellular networks, network conditions change based on obstacles, weather conditions between the client and the base stations, and even the movement of objects and people. As a result of the changes in the radio link, the data transfer rate can change rapidly, hence devices needs to adjust their communications based on the currently available data rate.The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is widely used for reliable data transfer over networks. However, TCP was initially designed when link data rates were much lower than the link data rates commonly available today. As a result, TCP does not perform well at high data rates, despite some of the changes that have been made to the protocol to support high data rate links. Moreover, TCP has problems adapting to large changes in link bandwidth (not caused by congestion), resulting in a lower average throughput than the link could potentially deliver.This thesis evaluates two different versions of the TCP protocol (e.g., TCP Reno and Cubic TCP) and proposes a network coding scheme to enhance users\\u2019 experience when communicating over unstable radio links. The performance of the two TCP protocols and Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) scheme were measured in an emulated network environment.

It is reliable and cost-effective and features error detection and fault confinement capabilities. CAN has been widely used in other applications, such as onboard trains, ships, construction vehicles, and aircraft. CAN has even been applied within the industrial automation segment in a range of devices such as programmable controllers, industrial robots, digital and analog I/O modules, sensors, etc. Despite its robustness and other positive features, the CAN bus has limitations in form of limited maximum data rate and maximum bus length. Also the CAN network topology is rigidly fixed which is a severe limiting factor in some of its application cases, therefore several industrial actors are evaluating alternatives to CAN.Ethernet is one of the potential candidates to replace CAN. It is a widespread and well knowntechnology, easily accessible, and many off-the-shelf solutions are available. It can support extended networks and offers wide possibilities in terms of network topology thanks to active switches. It features very high bandwidth, which has increased systematically from 10 Mbps to 100 Gbps year after year, always preserving backward compatibility to the maximum possible extent.The purpose of this thesis project is to investigate the possibility of replacing the CAN bus with Ethernet according to the following requirements:<ul><li>Standard off-the-shelf components and software stacks</li><li>No modification of the network node application software, i.e. messages formatted accordingto CAN protocols must be transferred by means of Ethernet.</li></ul>A main issue is that CAN is time deterministic; it is always possible to predict the maximum latency in a message transfer. On the other hand Ethernet is still considered unreliable for time-critical applications, although the advent of Ethernet switches has minimized this non-deterministic behavior.A unique approach to this issue is offered as a result of the work done by Time Critical Networks, a newly started Swedish company. Their tool makes it possible to calculate the maximum forwarding time of a frame in an Ethernet network. This tool may make it possible to validate the use of Ethernet for time-critical applications.CPAC Systems, a company in the Volvo group which develops and manufactures steer-by-wire systems based on the CAN technology, wishes to verify whether Ethernet could now be considered as a solution to complement or replace CAN, thus overcoming CAN\\u2019s limitations. This verification is the goal of this master thesis project.The work was carried out through three different phase:<ul><li>First we performed a theoretical evaluation by modeling the Ethernet network using Time Critical Network\\u2019s tools.</li><li>Next we verified the results by implementing the modeled CAN/Ethernet network that was previously modeled.</li><li>Finally, we validated the solution by directly testing the modeled CAN/Ethernet in combination with CPAC System\\u2019s steer-by-wire technology.</li></ul>The results obtained show that Ethernet in combination with Time Critical Network\\u2019s modeling tool, when it comes to time-determinism, can be a complement and/or an alternative to the CAN bus.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91049\", \"number-of-pages\": \"133\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"175\", \"keyword\": \"CANbus; CAN/Ethernet converter; Ethernet; real-time; steer-by-wire\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-07T08:35:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-06T16:57:19.464+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:31:49.317+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91049\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 133.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:617893\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2013]]}, \"title\": \"Evaluating a publish/subscribe proxy for HTTP\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Zhang\", \"given\": \"Yuanhui\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"With the increasingly high speed of the Internet and its wide spread usage, the current Internet architecture exhibits some problems. The publish/subscribe paradigm has been developed to support one of the most common patterns of communication. It makes \\u201cinformation\\u201d the center of communication and removes the \\u201clocation-identity split\\u201d (i.e., that objects are at specific locations to which you must communicate with to access the object). In this thesis project a publish/subscribe network is built and then used in the design, implementation, and evaluation of a publish/subscribe proxy for today\\u2019s HTTP based communication. By using this proxy users are able to use their existing web browser to send both HTTP requests and Publish/Subscribe Internet Routing Paradigm (PSIRP) requests. A publish/subscribe overlay is responsible for maintaining PSIRP contents. The proxy enables web browser clients to benefit from the publish/subscribe network, without requiring them to change their behavior or even be aware of the fact that the content that they want to access is being provided via the publish/subscribe overlay. The use of the overlay enables a user\\u2019s request to be satisfied by any copy of the content, potentially decreasing latency, reducing backbone network traffic, and reducing the load on the original content server. One of the aims of this thesis is to make more PSIRP content available, this is done by introducing a proxy who handles both HTTP and PSIRP requests, but having received content as a result of an HTTP response it publishes this data as PSIRP accessible content. The purpose is to foster the introduction and spread of content based access.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-121282\", \"number-of-pages\": \"70\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:68\", \"keyword\": \"Publish/Subscribe; HTTP proxy; Blackadder; PURSUIT; Pub/sub proxy; network metrics; Publicera / Prenumerera; HTTP-proxy; Blackadder; PURSUIT; Pub / sub proxy; n\\u00e4tverk statistik\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-04-25T09:09:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-04-24T20:09:43.259+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T00:38:45.528+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-121282\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 70.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:551105\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"Evaluating an IPv4 and IPv6 Network\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Lidholm\", \"given\": \"Gilbert\", \"localId\": \"u1mfnwpr\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Netterberg\", \"given\": \"Marcus\", \"localId\": \"u10xs6up\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This thesis is the result of the bachelor\\u2019s thesis project \\u201cEvaluating an IPv4 and IPv6 network\\u201d.The IPv6 protocol was created with the main purpose of solving the problem of the depletion of IPaddresses that IPv4 is currently facing.

With this thesis project an Earl device is able to send real-time data to Internet connected devices and to other Earl devices via a mobile phone acting as a gateway. This thesis project facilitates the use of Earl in design projects for IoT devices.IoT enables communication with many different kinds of \\u201cthings\\u201d such as cars, fridges, refrigerators, light bulbs, etc. The benefits of IoT range from financial savings due to saving energy to monitoring the heart activity of a patient with heart problems. There are many approaches to connect devices in order to create an IoT. One of these approaches is to use a mobile phone as a gateway, i.e., to act as a router, between IoT and the Internet.The WebSocket protocol provides efficient communication sessions between web servers and clients by reducing communication overhead. The WebRTC project aims to provide standards for real-time communications technology. WebRTC is important because it is the first real-time communications standard which is being built into browsers.This thesis evaluates the benefits which these two protocols offer when using a mobile phone as a gateway between an IoT and Internet. This thesis project implemented several test beds, collected data concerning the scalability of the protocols and the latency of traffic passing through the gateway, and presents a numerical analysis of the measurement results.

When the number of vehicles increases, platoons will follow one another in what is referred to as multiplatooning. Many Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) applications rely on periodically exchanged beacons among vehicles to improve traffic safety. However, as the number of connected vehicles increases, the network may become congested due to periodically exchanged beacons. Therefore, without some congestion control method, safety critical messages such as Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) may not be delivered on time in high vehicle density scenarios. Both the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) have been working on different standards to support vehicular communication. ETSI dened the Decentralized Congestion Control (DCC) mechanism which adapts transmission parameters (message rate, transmit data rate, and transmit power, etc.) to keep channel load under control. ETSI DCC utilizes a three-state machine with RELAXED, ACTIVE, and RESTRICTIVE states. In this thesis, we implemented this three-state machine by adapting the message rate based on the channel busy ratio (CBR). We name this message-rate based three-state machine DCC-3. DCC-3 has the ability to control channel load; however, it has unfairness and instability problems due to the dramatic parameter changes between states. Therefore, we divided the ACTIVE state of DCC-3 into ve sub-states, and refer to this as DCC-7. We benchmarked DCC-3 against static beaconing (STB), dynamic beaconing (DynB), LInear MEssage Rate Integrated Control (LIMERIC), and DCC-7 using different evaluation metrics with different numbers of platoons. Our results from the Plexe simulator demonstrate that DCC-7 has the best performance when considering all evaluation metrics, including CBR, Inter-reception time (IRT), collisions, safe time ratio, and fairness. Furthermore, we found using transmit power control could greatly improve the performance of CBR and collision rates.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-232849\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,62\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2018:464\", \"keyword\": \"Wireless vehicular communication; decentralized congestion control; cooperative awareness messages; multiplatooning; simulation; Tr\\u00e5dl\\u00f6s fordonskommunikation; decentraliserad \\u00f6verbelastning kontroll; kooperativ medvetenhet meddelanden; multiplatooning; simulering\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-09-03T13:43:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-08-04T14:21:43.740+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T19:55:32.312+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-232849\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 75.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:510476\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2009]]}, \"title\": \"Evaluation of Capuchin Application Programming Interface : Implementing a Mobile TV Client\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Feng\", \"given\": \"Xuan\", \"localId\": \"u1e8ggjt\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Edvardsson\", \"given\": \"Nils\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The purpose of this research was to evaluate the Capuchin API launched by Sony Ericsson at Lund, Sweden in 2008.

Consequentially, a company needs to provide its service on multiple devices, running different operating systems, in order to reach as many end-users as possible. This leads to increased development complexity and costs. To solve this issue, multiple cross-platform solutions have been proposed throughout the years. One such solution is Progressive Web Application, a set of techniques that aim to create web applications with features that have traditionally only been available to native applications.In recent years WebAssembly, a compilation target that allows languages other than JavaScript to run on the browser, has been introduced. With its compact binary format and compiled nature, its goal is to bring speed and performance enhancement to web applications.This thesis analyzes WebAssembly in the context of building a Progressive Web Application, particularly the impacts it has on the performance and memory usage. A comparison is made with the JavaScript library ReactJS. The results indicate that a Progressive Web Application built with WebAssembly achieves similar performance results as one built using ReactJS when it comes to computers, but performs worse on mobile platforms. The results also indicate that using a programming language such as Rust, although still introducing memory overhead, minimizes the bundle size and runtime memory consumption of the application.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-313941\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xvi,60\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": \"Progressve Web Applications; WebAssembly; Performance evaluation; Memory usage; Progressiva Webapplikationer; WebAssembly; Prestationsutv\\u00e4rdering; Minnesanv\\u00e4ndning\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-15T07:34:01.083+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-13T14:50:07.999+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-25T07:29:55.949+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-313941\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": \"Stockholm\", \"publisher\": \"KTH Royal Institute of Technology\", \"total_pages\": 76.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1159496\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2017]]}, \"title\": \"Evaluation of the Profitability of Quality of Experience-based Resource Allocation Deployment in LTE Network : A Techno-economic Assessment based on Quality of Experience in Video Traffic\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Ramadhani\", \"given\": \"Uri Arta\", \"localId\": \"u1vojmyr\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Hossain\", \"given\": \"Mohammad Istiak\", \"localId\": \"u1spxk5c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Martinez Ballesteros\", \"given\": \"Luis Guillermo\", \"localId\": \"u1o6sxfi\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"In the current mobile telecommunication market, with slow growth in mobile subscriptions and increasing traffi demand, each mobile operator needs to manage their customer loyalty in order to maintain position in the market. To retain their customer's loyalty, the user quality of satisfaction needs to be preserved. Integrating a Quality of Experience (QoE) approach into a radio resource scheduling scheme can be a means to improve user quality of satisfaction to a service. However, the enhancement of existing resource allocation management to support a QoE-based resource scheduling scheme needs a careful consideration since it will impact the mobile operator's investment cost. A profitability assessment of QoE-based resource allocation is required as a basis for the mobile operator to forecast their potential benefit of QoE-based resource scheduling deployment.This thesis investigated the profitability of deploying QoE-based radio resource management (RRM) in terms of revenue loss compared to proportional fair (PF) scheduling, a widely used resource allocation scheme, in delivering a streaming video service. In QoE-based RRM, a buffering percentage experienced by a user was considered in the resource allocation decision process. The two scheduling schemes were simulated in different network configurations. User satisfaction was quantified in terms of mean opinion score. Given the degree of satisfaction for each user, a number of users who would be likely to churn was obtained. A cost-benefit assessment was then conducted by predicting revenue loss due to customer churn.The results from the simulation and cost analysis show that although QoE-based resource scheduling provides users with a higher degree of satisfaction for more base stations, the utilization of a QoE-based resource scheduler does not offer significant benefit to the network operator with regard to revenue loss and deployment cost when compared to a PF scheduler. This outcome indicates that if the business target is to reduce customer churn, then the operator should utilize a PF scheduler for their RRM scheme.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-218073\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiv,61\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2017:197\", \"keyword\": \"Quality of Experience; radio resource management; video quality; mean opinion score; revenue loss; upplevad kvalitet; radio resurshantering; videokvalit\\u00e9t; medelv\\u00e4rde av graderingarna; inkomstf\\u00f6rlust\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-12-10T15:00:31.997+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-11-22T16:05:07.965+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T23:17:35.786+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-218073\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 75.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:448589\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2011]]}, \"title\": \"Evaluation of VoIP Security for Mobile Devices\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Nakarmi\", \"given\": \"Prajwol Kumar\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": null, \"abstract\": \"Market research reports by In-Stat, Gartner, and the Swedish Post and Telecom Agency (PTS) reveal a growing worldwide demand for Voice over IP (VoIP) and smartphones.

This application-to-person traffic is delivered to end users through SMS aggregators who provide the link between service providers and mobile carriers. In order to perform optimal traffic routing, the aggregators need to estimate the quality of each potential international route to the specified destination. The evaluation criteria include end-to-end delivery time, as well as correct verification of delivered data.\\nThis thesis suggests a method of quality of service (QoS) assessment for international SMS service which combines two types of tests, end-to-end delay measurements and various verification tests. A prototype of the testing system for international SMS service was developed to generate SMS traffic, collect and analyze results, and evaluate the experienced QoS of the SMS route used in accordance with the proposed approach. As a part of end-to- end delay measurement tests, SMS traffic was sent to Singtel network in Singapore along two routes. The verification tests were executed via different routes to two mobile networks: Singtel and Tele2 (Sweden). The results of the performed measurements determined the route with the highest QoS, i.e. the one with bigger bottleneck bandwidth and lower data loss rate.\\nThe prototype of the SMS testing system can be used by SMS aggregators to verify delivery of a SMS message, check the integrity of the message, figure out interconnection type of the route supplier with the destination carrier and to identify the presence of load balancers in the path. The prototype also makes it possible to compare end-to-end delay times of several routes and compute bottleneck values for each of the tested routes.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-49828\", \"number-of-pages\": \"57\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"180\", \"keyword\": \"SMS; QoS; packet-pair; TOPP; end-to-end delay; bottleneck bandwidth; aggregator\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-11-30T10:41:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-11-30T10:41:30.390+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T19:53:38.752+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-49828\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 57.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:538636\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"EVH2 protocol : Performance analysis and Wireshark dissector development\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"\\u00c5hman\", \"given\": \"Stefan\", \"localId\": \"u10284r5\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Wallstersson\", \"given\": \"Marcus\", \"localId\": \"u1xj98np\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"S\\u00f6derstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Pontus\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Aptilo Networks\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Eriksson\", \"given\": \"Peter\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Aptilo Networks\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"EVH2 is a proprietary application layer protocol developed by Aptilo Networks and used in their software product.

One of the main reason that is examined in this project is packet interleaving that takes place in the routers and switches along the path that the packets take from a computer to/from the datacenter. This project take a more general look at traffic arriving at a server via a tree of network devices on the uplink path to the server. The focus is to use scripts to create a tree of switches and conduct experiments with them by scripting Mininet. From these experiments we learned that the different algorithms that control the output queues of the network nodes across the network path play a significant role in packet interleaving. Furtheromore, experiments on Mininet host connectivity explained how with the Openflow protocol, Mininet controller set up rules in the switches of the network topology. Finally, experiments in TCP throughput showed the limiting factors of a TCP connection between the server and a host while many provided traffic flows illustrate common behaviors of packet interleaving that occurs due to the switches.\\u00a0\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-310022\", \"number-of-pages\": \"158\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2022:48\", \"keyword\": \"packet order; packet interleaving; temporal and spatial locality; visualization; paketordning; paketinterfoliering; temporal och rumslig lokalitet; visualisering\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-03-21T12:00:31.407+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-03-18T08:20:32.463+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-25T08:47:34.780+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-310022\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 158.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1394395\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2020]]}, \"title\": \"Expanding KTH's Canvas ecosystem to support additional automated services : Automating the injection of theses and their metadata into a digital archive\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Fallahian\", \"given\": \"Shayan\", \"localId\": \"u1pz3yw4\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879305\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Zioris\", \"given\": \"Konstantinos\", \"localId\": \"u132y5ds\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879305\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879305\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Whenever a student submits their final version of their thesis, a series of processes is triggered to finalize and archive the report.

In the former case, the application subscribes to room occupancy information via a context server, and provides a Meeting Room Booking System with \\u201creal-time\\u201d information about the utilization of the rooms which the room booking system is to manage. The Call Secretary acquires both location and room occupancy information from a server. When the user is in one of the meeting rooms and multiple people are present, then this is interpreted as the user being in a meeting -- therefore it triggers a CPL module in a SIP proxy to redirect the user\\u2019s incoming call to their voice mail box. A description of the implementation of these two applications will be presented along with an evaluation of these applications\\u2019 performance.The evaluation of the Context Agent showed that it was straightforward to integrate information from a presence source and to extend the meeting room booking system to use this information. The Call Secretary needs a more reliable source for the user's location. However, given this location the Call Secretary provides the service which the user expects.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91663\", \"number-of-pages\": \"176\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2008-27\", \"keyword\": \"Context-aware application; SIP; SIMPLE; XML; CPL; SER; GPS; Position determination\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-20T10:34:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-19T15:44:08.076+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:19:59.327+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91663\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 176.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:616001\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2013]]}, \"title\": \"Exploiting social networking technologies in order to enhance internal communication <i>within</i> and <i>across</i> a large enterprise : Improving a Corporate Social Network\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Paredes Sanz\", \"given\": \"Jesus\", \"localId\": \"u1oejl23\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Today the use of the social networking technologies is becoming more common in users daily lives, both their professional and personal lives.

Furthermore, the evolution of wireless technologies has facilitated their ubiquity. Moreover, is in locations such as homes and offices where exploitation of the data from these sensors has been more important. For example, we want to know if the temperature in our home is adequate, otherwise we want to turn on the heating (or cooling) system automatically and we want to be able to monitor the environment of the home or office remotely. The knowledge from these sensors and the ability to actuate devices, summon human assistance, and adjust contracts for electrical power, heating, cooling, etc. can facilitate a myriad of ways to improve the quality of our life and potentially even reduce resource consumption.\\nThis master\\u2018s thesis project created a gateway that sniffs wireless sensor traffic in order to collect data from existing sensors and to provide this data as input to various services. These sensors work in the 868 MHz band. Although these wireless sensors are frequently installed in homes and offices, they are generally not connected to any network. We designed a gateway capable of identifying these wireless sensors and decoding the received messages, despite the fact that these messages may use a vendor\\u2018s proprietary protocol. This gateway consists of a microcontroller, a radio transceiver (868-915 MHz), and an Ethernet controller.\\nThis gateway enables us to take advantage of all the data that can be captured. Thinking about these possibilities, simultaneously acquiring data from these various sensors could open a wide range of alternatives in different fields, such as home automation, industrial controlling\\u2026 Not only can the received data be interesting by itself; but when different sensors are located in the same environment we can exploit this data using sensor fusion. For example, time differences in arrival and differences in signal strength as measured t multiple receivers could be used to locate objects.\\nThe final aim of this thesis project is to support diverse applications that could be developed using the new gateway. This gateway creates a bridge between the information that is already around us and our ability to realize many new potential services. A wide range of opportunities could be realized by exploiting the wireless sensors we already have close to us.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98209\", \"number-of-pages\": \"81\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:110\", \"keyword\": \"wireless sensor gateway; microcontoller; power over ethernet\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-26T13:50:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-20T10:15:04.887+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:10:05.949+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98209\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 81.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:374024\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2010]]}, \"title\": \"Exploring the limits of cloud computing\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Delgado\", \"given\": \"Victor\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": null, \"abstract\": \"Cloud computing \\u00e4r en ny computing paradigm som, precis som elektricitet var f\\u00f6rst genereras hemma och utvecklats som skall levereras fr\\u00e5n ett f\\u00e5tal verktyg leverant\\u00f6rer, syftar till att omvandla data till ett verktyg.

This thesis explores the use of the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) to provide synchronization of radio base stations, rather than the current practice of using GPS radio receivers.Advantages of utilizing PTP rather than a GPS radio receiver include the ability to easily locate radio base stations (without the need for connecting the GPS radio receiver to an antenna that has line of sight to a sufficient number of GPS satellites); the system is not vulnerable to interference with or jamming of GPS radio signals; the system is not vulnerable to spoofing of GPS radio signals, and because the new generations of radio base stations are connected to a packet based backhaul link \\u2013 the system can potentially utilize the existing packet network interface (thus avoiding the need for a serial interface to the GPS receiver and a pulse per second input).At the start of this thesis project it was not known what the limits of PTP are (in terms of utilizing PTP together with radio base stations). Thus it was not clear whether PTP could be extended to much longer distances than it had originally been designed for.&lt;p&gt; This thesis shows that PTP can be used as an accurate timing source to synchronize base stations in networks with up to four switches between the PTP grandmaster and any PTP slave.&lt;p&gt; This project was performed in the Common Transport Feature department at Ericsson.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-141136\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiv,98\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:252\", \"keyword\": \"precision time protocol; radio base station; synchronization; precisions tid protokoll; radiobasstation; synkronisering\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-02-12T10:19:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-02-08T15:22:41.459+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T21:05:29.684+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-141136\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 112.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:528538\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1998]]}, \"title\": \"Extranet Security\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"M\\u00e4kel\\u00e4\", \"given\": \"Sami\", \"localId\": \"u1ibxjzo\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Kragsterman\", \"given\": \"Jan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Mijada AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This paper is a report of a 20 point Exam Project concerning security systems intended for Extranets.

In the end, this report presents with a recommendation for the consulting company MIJADA Sverige AB about which security system they should choose to implement in their network.\\nSSL is widely used and gives strong encryption and authentication through certificates. IPSec is not yet spread over a large market, but it offers a very flexible solution. Kerberos has great security mechanisms, but requires a lot of work and can be pretty hard to implement in an Extranet. S-HTTP conquers with SSL about security on the web market. Since it is intended for web traffic only, it is not an alternative for MIJADA to chose. PGP have very strong security mechanisms and overcomes the United States export laws, but to implement it implies also an own implementation of a protocol stack, which requires a large amount of extra time.\\nThe recommendation that this paper present for MIJADA is to choose SSL as underlying security technology, since it is most flexible and offers the best way to achieve mobility, i.e., allowing users to login to the Extranet from different computers. Furthermore, this paper recommends employing firewalls on both sides of the server running the SSL security component. One of them protects the server from being tampered, and the other protects the Extranet from harmful data that in somehow has passed the server.

Developers with or even without knowledge of the IMS architecture and signaling should be able to use these interfaces in order to develop applications on top of IMS.\\nA client-server application is designed and implemented to facilitate this evaluation and to serve as an example for others. The motivation behind this application is the every day needs of the people who search for discounts while they are shopping. Users set up their profile by specifying their preference concerning discounts for specific products; while shop owners publish discounts. When a user is near a store which offers interesting discounts (i.e., discounts that match their profile) new notifications will be sent to his/her mobile device. This application exploits the MJCF APIs and uses several of its basic functions; specifically subscriptions, messages, notifications, and publications are some of the messages that can be utilized through these interfaces.&lt;/p&gt; Throughout the application development, bugs were found in the APIs and corrections were suggested for the documentation. Measurements were made in order to evaluate the memory utilization and delay associated with these APIs. It was observed that the delays added by the APIs are somewhat high and may negatively affect the experience of users.

Each technology is appropriate for specific applications. Gigabit Ethernet is appropriate in areas where high data throughput is required, but QoS is not a main concern. ATM is appropriate in environments where video, voice, and other delay sensitive traffic exist. Fast Ethernet has the best price/performance for regular desktop connections.

To achieve this goal, a mechanism offering reliable and systematic protocol verification is needed. Accordingly, a major interest in academic research on formal methods for protocol analysis has been apparent for the last two decades. Such methods formalize the operational semantics of a protocol, laying the base for protocol verification with automatic model checking tools.So far, little work in this field has focused on protocol standardization. Within this thesis a security analysis of a novel Authenticated Key-Exchange (AKE) protocol for secure association handover between two Long-Term Evolution (LTE) base stations (which support dual-connectivity) is carried out by applying two state-of-the-art tools for automated model checking (Scyther and Tamarin Prover). In the course of this a formal protocol model and tool input models are developed. Finally, the suitability of the used tools for LTE protocol analysis is evaluated.The major outcome is that none of the two applied tools is capable to accurately model and verify the dual-connectivity protocol in such detail that it would make them particularly useful in the considered setting. The reason for this are restrictions in the syntax of Scyther and a degraded performance of Tamarin when using complex protocol input models. However, the use of formal methods in protocol standardization can be highly beneficial, since it implies a careful consideration of a protocol\\u2019s fundamentals. Hence, formal methods are helpful to improve and structure a protocol\\u2019s design process when applied in conjunction to current practices.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-148047\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xvii,85\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2014:94\", \"keyword\": \"security; authenticated key-exchange; 3GPP; LTE; formal methods; protocol verification; automated model checking; s\\u00e4kerhet; autentiserad etablering av nycklar; 3GPP; LTE; formella metoder; protokollverifiering; automatiserad modellverifiering\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-08-05T15:51:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-07-18T16:22:01.062+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T19:18:06.741+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-148047\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 102.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:753000\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2014]]}, \"title\": \"From Set Top Box to Home Media Center\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Fu\", \"given\": \"Yi\", \"localId\": \"u1bybb0s\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Li\", \"given\": \"Ruimin\", \"localId\": \"u1519ool\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Eriksson\", \"given\": \"Andreas\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Zenterio AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Although Set-top-Boxes(STBs) are widely deployed today to connect a media source to a display (traditionally a television set), the market is changing due to the introduction of Internet Protocol Television, Over-the-Top streaming devices, gaming console, home theater Personal Computer, smart TV, etc. There is an evolving concept of a Home Media Center (HMC).

These maps are often hand drawn and are designed to be visually pleasing while still providing an overview of the terrain of a ski resort. As smartphones have become the go-to tool when satisfying our daily navigational needs, the expectations of a digital map have changed. One of these expectations is being able to position yourself and others on the map. With the existing GPS functionality of smartphones, there is a great potential for bringing classical piste maps into the digital age. This project proposes a solution which can position a user given their geographical position on a piste map. The solution includes a process for identifying anchor points which tie geographical coordinates to piste map coordinates, a suitable method of triangulating these points, combined with an algorithm that finds the most suitable triangle to use for finding the transformation parameters, and finally an affine transformation that yields the corresponding piste map coordinates for a given geographical position. The solution also proposes a method to find the smallest but sufficient set size of anchor points for a resort to create a useful and cost efficient model of transformation. The thesis work also presents possible implementations of the positioning algorithm, such as creating a smooth transition between a piste map view and a satellite map view in an Android device. This includes automatic panning and rotation of the satellite map in response to the centering of the piste map on the device screen. Geo-enabling piste maps enables many more interesting applications, such as recording and displaying skiing statistics, providing suggestions of new unexplored areas, keeping track of family or friends, selective location sharing, location-tagged weather and disaster information, and in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, providing a user- friendly interface for displaying localized congestion levels.\\u00a0\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-298026\", \"number-of-pages\": \"70\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2021:218\", \"keyword\": \"Georeferencing; Positioning; Coordinate Transformations; Piste maps; Geografiska referenspunkter; Positionering; Koordinattransformationer; Pistkartor\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2021-06-28T09:53:36.176+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2021-06-24T17:33:25.864+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-25T12:05:30.678+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-298026\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 70.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:526424\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"Global Secure Message Handling\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Lindman\", \"given\": \"Johannes\", \"localId\": \"u15un3t0\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Johansson\", \"given\": \"Peter\", \"localId\": \"u1psaq0a\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Nilsson\", \"given\": \"Torkel\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"ABN Amro Software\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Targama\", \"given\": \"Jakob\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"ABN Amro Software\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The goal of this report is to devise a mechanism for sending messages in a non-secure environment, such as the Internet.

S/MIME has been chosen because it provides the desired security mechanisms and has been a de facto standard.\\nThere are many alternatives when composing an S/MIME message. To be able to understand how the choice affects throughput and latency, an S/MIME application has been implemented in Java. The application is used for performance measurements on two different communication models.\\nThe measurements show that the relative difference in latency for the two implemented communication models is about 170%.

These meetings provided feedback on the direction the project was taking as well as provided input (such as ideas for features to implement).The result of this thesis project shows a way to display the status of an AAA system with multiple properties displayed at the same time. It combines this with a view of the flow of messages and application of policies in the network via a dynamically generated UML sequence diagram.

In this thesis the Luna SA 1700 capabilities are stated and a comprehensive analysis of its performance shows a performance gap between what HSMs are currently able to do and what they need to do to address the expected demands. A case study focused on new security services needed to address Sweden's e Identification organization is presented. Based upon the expected performance demands, this thesis project proposes an optimized HSM solution to address the identified performance gap between what is required and what current HSMs can provide. A series of tests were conducted to measure an existing HSM's performance. An analysis of these measurements was used to optimize a proposed solution for selected HSM or similar HSMs. One of the main requirements of the new signing service is the capability to perform fifty digital signatures within the acceptable response time which is 300 ms during normal hours and 3000 ms during peak hours. The proposed solution enables the HSM to meet the expected demands of 50 signing request per second in the assumed two hours of peak rate at a cost that is 1/9 of the cost of simply scaling up the number of HSMs.The target audience of this thesis project is Security Service Providers who use HSMs and need a high volume of key generation and storing.

However, its development has slowed because it is approaching the Shannon limit of nonlinear fiber transmission. Researchers are looking for multi dimensional multiplexing. Space-division multiplexing (SDM) is an ideal way to scale network capacities. The capacity of WDM/SDM network could be expanded to several times the capacity of WDM network but the active hardware devices may also increase by several times.This project aims to answer a practical question: How to construct a WDM/SDM network with less hardware resource? There is no mature research about WDM/SDM network yet. Therefore, the problem can be divided into two parts: (1) how to build a WDM/SDM network and (2) how to allocate resource and compute routes in such a network to minimize hardware resources.First, this thesis proposes a WDM/SDM node which has bypass connections between different fibers and architecture on demand (AoD) to effectively decrease the number of active hardware devices within the node. Then, two types of networks were constructed: one with bypass connections in each node and another one without any bypass connections. These networks were under the control of a software defined network (SDN) controller. The controller knew the wavelength resources within the networks. Several algorithms were applied to these networks to evaluate the effect of a bypass network and to identify the desired characteristics (to find short length path and decrease the probability of spectrum fragmentation) of an algorithm suitable for a network with bypass connections. The results of applying the proposed algorithms in two networks proved that the bypass connections increased the blocking probability in small topology but did not affect the results in large topology. The results in a large-scale network with bypass network were almost the same as the results in a network without bypass connections. Thus, bypass connections are suitable for large-scale network.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-261155\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,69\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2019:695\", \"keyword\": \"WDM; SDM; SDN; routing and wavelength assignment; large-scale network; hardware resource; WDM; SDM; SDN; routing och tilldelning av v\\u00e5gl\\u00e4ngd; storskaligt n\\u00e4tverk; h\\u00e5rdvara resurs\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2019-10-14T07:14:38.265+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2019-10-02T10:52:35.659+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T13:35:47.233+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-261155\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 82.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1678555\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2022]]}, \"title\": \"Hardware-in-the-loop Simulation of a Pumping Station : Design and implementation of a Python-based simulation program\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Liang\", \"given\": \"Katrina\", \"localId\": \"u1jwhwdj\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879223\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r elektroteknik och datavetenskap (EECS)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Stjern\", \"given\": \"Magnus\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Xylem Water Solutions AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The use of simulation enables testing of a system without the need for a complete physical system, while also having the advantages of lower cost and fewer practical limits compared to field tests.

Nevertheless, the developers do not always have access to a real pumping station to run tests on. A HIL simulator that imitates parts of a pumping station while including a real controller in the simulation is therefore desirable for the development of pump controllers.In this thesis, a mathematical model of a pumping station was built based on the physical features of different components, and a HIL simulation was implemented with the programming language Python, in which a real controller was integrated into the simulation loop.Through a three-hour-long simulation run, the functionality of the simulator has been analyzed, and the simulation accuracy was evaluated by comparing simulated results to real data.

This thesis contributes to the field of Python-based simulation of a pumping station, and serves as a foundation for future improvement for the host company.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-315066\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xi,49\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": \"Hardware-in-the-loop simulation; Simulation; Modeling; Pumping stations; Pump controller; Hardware-in-the-loop simulering; Simulering; Modellering; Pumpstationer; Pumpstyrning\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-30T12:01:25.186+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-29T14:29:22.507+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-30T12:01:25.229+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-315066\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": \"Stockholm\", \"publisher\": \"KTH Royal Institute of Technology\", \"total_pages\": 60.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1107146\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2017]]}, \"title\": \"Heterogeneous Residential Gateway Design Using OSGi : With multi-user and multi-service capabilities\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Mani\", \"given\": \"GaneshKumar\", \"localId\": \"u1o5a8wt\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Junique\", \"given\": \"Stephane\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Acreo\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"As a result of developments, domestic usage of smart appliances by homeowners is increasing drastically.

A service-oriented architecture is proposed using the OSGi framework to design the residential gateway and its individual components. These components include an access control component for homeowner authorization, a resource management component for managing connected devices, an automation component to realize an automation service, and finally a context component to provide context aware services to the homeowner.The final design proposed tries to solve the issues faced by some automation systems that are available in market. The evaluation of the design includes whether the design satisfies the basic requirements for a home gateway. This is followed by a comparison with existing systems with an emphasis on the improved features.

To gain an increased understanding of the threat landscape in RANs and potentially increase the overall security for RANs, this thesis project designed, implemented, and evaluated a honeypot for Ericsson\\u2019s RAN. Developing a suitable honeypot required an initial literature study of honeypots, RANs, and Long-Term Evolution (LTE) networks. In addition, previous research and work related to this topic were included in the literature study. The open-source Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) honeypot project, Cowrie, was used as a fundamental building block for the honeypot. Moreover, a high-level architecture of the honeypot system (HoneyRAN) was designed and used as a basis for the implementation process. For evaluating the honeypot, a penetration test was conducted in which an internal Ericsson penetration tester evaluated the honeypot. The Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) stack was utilised to facilitate log analysis. The results from the penetration test were better than expected and are promising as HoneyRAN achieved the three claimed goals/objectives: understanding adversarial behaviour and tactics, stalling the adversaries, and early detection of attacks. The outcome of the evaluation suggests that HoneyRAN is a good initial approach for increasing the overall security of RANs and that honeypots are an effective deception technique for stalling attackers. The conclusions from the evaluation of HoneyRAN are that HoneyRAN\\u2019s implementation using Cowrie achieved an essential desired outcome, namely realism, deception strategies are essential to implement deception techniques (such as honeypots) effectively, and the design and implementation choices of HoneyRAN provides a foundation for other solutions.\\u00a0\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-305168\", \"number-of-pages\": \"114\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2021:712\", \"keyword\": \"Honeypot; HoneyRAN; Medium Interaction Honeypot; Cowrie; SSH Honeypot; RAN Honeypot; RAN security; Honungskruka; HoneyRAN; Medelinteraktion honungskruka; Cowrie; SSH honungskruka; RAN honungskruka; RAN s\\u00e4kerhet\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2021-11-23T12:52:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2021-11-22T15:41:32.239+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-25T09:59:36.550+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-305168\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 114.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:513071\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2005]]}, \"title\": \"Horizontal Handoffs within WLANs : A detailed analysis and measurement concerning voice like traffic\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Nankani\", \"given\": \"Ajeet\", \"localId\": \"u1fi1kyv\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"B\\u00f6rjeson\", \"given\": \"Ulf\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"R2M AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"IEEE 802.11 based Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) in addition to being used as access networks for providing traditional data services, are now also being used as access networks for providing realtime services such as VoIP and multimedia streaming. These realtime services are sensitive to latency, hence requiring seamless or low delay service from the lower layers throughout an ongoing session. The IEEE 802.11 standard does not define any technique or algorithm to provide seamless connectivity during the process of handoff, hence it does not require 802.11 based WLANs to provide the same. Thus, it is typical that there is a latency of 500 milliseconds to 1000 milliseconds during the handoff, before the mobile station can connect and receive data from the new access point (AP). However, many realtime services can not tolerate this much latency.The problem of handoff latency is further aggravated when WLANs are secured using IEEE 802.11i standard and when Authentication, Authorization &amp; Accounting (AAA) services are involved in controlling network access to 802.11 based WLANs. This thesis will address the entire handoff process and examine the latency -- especially regarding AAA services. Different techniques and suggestions will be presented and analyzed closely at different layers and based on the results, an appropriate/efficient algorithm is suggested which will reduce this handoff latency, such that that seamless handoff can be achieved and realtime services can be provided over 802.11i enabled IEEE 802.11 WLANs.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92271\", \"number-of-pages\": \"61\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-IMIT-LCN.

Time division (TD) scheduling in Wideband Code Division Multiplex Access (WCDMA) is considered to be a key feature in achieving high user data rates. Unfortunately, power oscillation/peak is observed in time division multiplexing (TDM) at the transition between active and inactive transmission time intervals [1]. Therefore there is a need to revisit power control algorithms for different time division scheduling scenarios.The objective of power control in the context of this study is to minimize the required rise over thermal noise (RoT) for a given data rate, subject to the constraint that the physical layer control channel quality is sufficient (assuming that the dedicated physical control channel (DPCCH) SIR should not go below 3dB with a probability of at most 5%). Another goal is to minimize the local oscillation in power (power peaks) that may occur, for example due to transitions between active and inactive transmission time intervals.The considered hybrid power control schemes are: (1) non-parametric Generalized rake receiver SIR (GSIR) Inner Loop Power Control (ILPC) during active transmission time intervals + Received Signal Code Power (RSCP) ILPC during inactive transmission time intervals and (2) RSCP ILPC during active transmission time intervals + GSIR ILPC during inactive transmission time intervals. Both schemes are compared with pure GSIR and pure RSCP ILPC.Link level simulations with multiple users connected to a single cell show that:<ul><li>The power peak problem is obviously observed in GSIR + GSIR transmit power control (TPC), but in general it performs well in all time division scenarios studied.

Among all TPC methods presented, GSIR + GSIR TPC is best in maintaining the quality of the DPCCH channel. No power rush is observed when using GSIR + GSIR TPC.</li><li>RSCP + RSCP eliminates the power peak problem and outperforms other TPC methods presented under the 3GPP Pedestrial A (pedA) 3km/h channel in terms of RoT. However, in general it is worse in maintaining the control channel\\u2019s quality than GSIR + GSIR TPC.</li><li>GSIR + RSCP ILPC eliminates the power peak problem and out-performs GSIR power control in the scenario of 2 and 4 TDM high data rate (HDR) UE and 2 TDM HDR UE coexistence with 4 Code DivisionMultiplex (CDM) LDR UE, in the pedA 3km/h channel, in terms of RoT.

Discrete event simulation is a major experimental methodology in several scientific and engineering domains. Unfortunately, a conventional discrete event simulator cannot meet with increasing demands of computational or the structural complexities of modern systems such as peer-to-peer (P2P) systems; therefore parallel discrete event simulation has been a focus of researchers for several decades.\\nUnfortunately, no simulator is regarded as a standard which can satisfy the demands of all kinds of applications. Thus while given a simulator yields good performance for a specific kind of applications, it may failed to be efficient for other kinds of applications. Furthermore, although technological advancements have been made in the multi-core computing hardware, none of the mainstream P2P discrete event simulators is designed to support parallel simulation that exploits multi-core architectures. The proposed HydraNetSim parallel discrete event simulator (PDES) is a step toward addressing these issues. Developing a simulator which can support very large numbers of nodes to realize a massive P2P system, and can also execute in parallel is a non-trivial task. The literature review in this thesis gives a broad overview of prevailing approaches to dealing with the tricky problems of simulating a massive, large, and rapidly changing system, and provides a foundation for adopting a suitable architecture for developing a PDES.\\nHydraNetSim is a discrete event simulator which allows parallel simulation and exploits the capabilities of parallelization of modern computing hardware. It is based on a novel master/slave paradigm. It divides the simulation model into a number of specific slaves (a cluster of processes) considering the number of cores provided by the underlying computing hardware. Each slave can be assigned to a specific CPU on a different core. Synchronization of the slaves is achieved by proposing a variant of the classic Null-Message Algorithm (NMA) with a focus on keeping the synchronization overhead as low as possible.

Microservices provides many benefits that help with code base comprehension, deployability, testability, and scalability. As the Information technology (IT) industry has grown ever larger, it makes sense for the technology giants to adopt the microservice architecture to make use of these benefits. However, with new software solutions come new security vulnerabilities, especially when the technology is new and vulnerabilities are yet to be fully mapped out. Authentication and authorization are the cornerstone of any application that has a multitude of users. However, due to the lack of studies of microservices, stemming from their relatively young age, there are no standardized design patterns for how authentication and authorization are best implemented in a microservice. This thesis investigates an existing microservice in order to secure it by applying what is known as a security design pattern for authentication and authorization. Different security patterns were tested and compared on performance. The differing levels of security provided by these approaches assisted in identifying an acceptable security versus performance trade-off. Ultimately, the goal was to give the patterns greater validity as accepted security patterns within the area of microservice security. Another goal was to find such a security pattern suitable for the given microservice used in this project. The results showed a correlation between increased security and longer response times. For the general case a security pattern which provided internal authentication and authorization but with some trust between services was suggested. If horizontal scaling was used the results showed that normal services proved to be the best target. Further, it was also revealed that for lower user counts the performance penalties were close to equal between the tested patterns. This meant that for the specific case where microservices sees lower amounts of traffic the recommended pattern was the one that implemented the maximum amount access control checks. In the case for the environment where the research were performed low amounts of traffic was seen and the recommended security pattern was therefore one that secured all services of the microservices.\\u00a0\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-301620\", \"number-of-pages\": \"87\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2021:390\", \"keyword\": \"Authentication; Authorization; Access control; Microservices; Microservice Security; Security Tokens; Security Patterns; Performance; Autentisering; Auktorisering; \\u00c5tkomstkontroll; Mikrotj\\u00e4nster; Mikrotj\\u00e4nsts\\u00e4kerhet; S\\u00e4kerhetstokens; S\\u00e4kerhetsdesignm\\u00f6nster; Prestanda; Belastningstestning\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2021-09-10T09:32:27.843+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2021-09-09T09:49:20.468+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-25T11:08:54.510+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-301620\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 87.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:510981\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2008]]}, \"title\": \"Implementation and Analysis of VoIP CPE Management System using TR-069\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Darwis\", \"given\": \"Darwis\", \"localId\": \"u1pscjb0\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Cederberg\", \"given\": \"Olle\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"42networks AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) management is underestimated by the CPE vendors and services providers while it is in fact one of the most important aspects to ensure the high quality of service.

In the addition, the TR-069 will be compared against the SNMP to determine which one is more suitable for CPE management.

This thesis addresses the problem of service discovery in peer-to-peer mobile networks by implementing and evaluating a previously designed protocl (the Service Peer Discovery Protocol).The main feature of peer-to-peer networks is that users connected to them can communicate directly with each other, without the necessity of interaction via a central point. However, in order for two networks users (ir peers) to communicate, they must have a means to locate and address each other, which is in gernal called a discovery protocol.There are many different solutions for discoverying protocols that work efficiently in fixed or slow-moving networks, but full mobility introduces a set of new difficulties for the discovery of peers and their services. The potential changes in location, which can occur very ofter, the changes in IP address that these changes cuase, and roaming between networks of different kinds are good examples of these difficulties.To solve these problems, a new Service Peer Discovery Protocol was designed and a test application built. The next step towards the introduction of this protocol was creating a working implementation, setting up a suitable test environment, performing experiments, and evaluating its performance. This evaluation could lead to improvments in the protoocl. The aim of this thesis is to implement and document the Service Peer Discovery Protocol, to carry out measurements of it, to evaluate the efficiency of the protocol, and to suggest ways in which it could be improved.The Service Peer Discovery Protocol was found to be well targeted to wireless, peer-to-peer networks, althgouh improvements in the protocol could make it more time and traffic-efficient while maintaining the same level of performance.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92581\", \"number-of-pages\": \"83\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-IMIT-LCN.

The AUTomotive Open System Architecture (AUTOSAR) was created to standardize the automotive software. In this architecture, the development of software is spread, in general, between three different entities: Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), e.g. Volvo; Tier-1 Suppliers, such as Vector; and Tier-2 Suppliers, for example, Renesas Microelectronics. Another methodology that has emerged is to develop Electronic Control Units (ECUs) domain wise: infotainment, chassis &amp; safety, powertrain, and body and security. To allow inter-domain communication, the state of art for fast and reliable communication is to use a gateway ECU.The gateway ECU is a crucial component in the electrical/electronic (E/E) architecture of a vehicle. In AUTOSAR, a third party, different from the car manufacturer, typically implements the gateway ECU. A major feature for a gateway ECU is to provide highly flexible configuration. This flexibility allows the car manufacturer (OEM) to fit the gateway ECU to different requirements and product derivations.This thesis investigates the implementation of post-build configuration for a gateway ECU. First, the thesis provides the reader with some background on AUTOSAR and the current E/E architecture of the gateway ECU. The protocols used by the gateway are explained.

Processing time, memory use, and scaling of the solution are also taken into account.The results of the design and the implementation if judged adequate could be used as a springboard to allow post-build in an existing gateway ECU architecture.

Today nearly everybody uses computers more or less frequently. The trend is now that everyone has a little computer connected to others in a network. The computing power has become more decentralized, and therefore the need for communication has increased. Another thing that has changed the pattern is that the computers has become so small that it is no longer any problem to move them as long as one does not care about the network support, but of course one would like to have both the mobility and the network support.In my master thesis project I have implemented and evaluated parts of a new approach for dealing with the problems with mobility. This approach is called the mobile floating agent technique, and was developed by George Y. Liu at Ericsson Radio Systems AB, Kista. The main idea behind this is to have floating agents in the network, i.e. software entities that are virtually floating around in the network, arranging files and resources for the mobile user so that he can connect to a server in his neighbourhood, instead of connecting to his own server far away.\\u00a0 I have implemented a simple file system testbed that uses the floating agent technique for caching purposes. There are two reasons for doing this implementation. The reason is for evaluation of the caching features, and the second reason is to have a platform to implement more advanced agent functions on.The design of the system has been done in an object oriented style, and the implementation has been done in C++.The system consists of two parts. One part is the client software, which has been implemented in another project, but modified by me, and runs on aPC with the Windows95 OS. The other part is the network part of the system, i.e. the part of the system that is not running in the client, is made for running on an UNIX station. The network part of the system consists of two parts itself. There are mobile floating agent managers, that manages the whole system, and agents, that serves the mobile clients, and communicates with both the client software and the mobile floating agent managers.In the evaluation part of the project I have compared the delay acquired when accessing a file in a remote network with and without an agent. I finally came to the conclusion that the gain won with the use of caches in the agents is maybe not as large that one should use caching as the primary object of the agents.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-104477\", \"number-of-pages\": \"49\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-11-05T15:42:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-11-05T13:33:07.625+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T02:42:00.933+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-104477\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 49.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511671\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2007]]}, \"title\": \"Implementing a virtual private network\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Samuelsson\", \"given\": \"Joakim\", \"localId\": \"u1gfwsod\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Sandsund\", \"given\": \"Richard\", \"localId\": \"u1nlxksr\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Dagens f\\u00f6retag vill ge anst\\u00e4llda m\\u00f6jlighet att jobba hemifr\\u00e5n eller p\\u00e5 resande fot.

The focus of this report is a general solution for communicating alarm information from external systems to the WCU. A given requirement was that the solution must be based on SOA. Therefore, the concept of SOA is investigated and its applicability is considered for the WCU architecture.\\nA design proposal based on a combination of open information and communication technologies was made to show how WCU may use SOA to receive alarm information from external systems. The design proposal was evaluated by a load test as well as comparing its conformance to SOA. The load test showed that the proposed solution can process incoming messages at a rate of 2 ms per message when client and server are run on the same machine. The result of the comparison showed that the WCU can, with small modifications, apply a SOA.\\nWhile this thesis has only investigated the use of SOA in the context of alarm information, there is a clear trend toward integrating information for diverse systems to enable users to have better quality information. Providing first responders with the information that they need, when and where they need it can enable them to save lives, save property, and reduce the risk to the public of incidents.\\nAn important result from this thesis is the observation that a system that needs to integrate with many distinct systems can be better prepared if made SOA conformant. This requires the system to have an interface towards other systems based on platform independent protocols. Systems such as the WCU, which are based on Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), can easily add such an interface by configuring WCF in an appropriate way.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92027\", \"number-of-pages\": \"68\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2007-04\", \"keyword\": \"SOA; .NET; WCF; Web Services; alarm system; XML\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-26T10:55:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T17:14:42.524+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:14:10.163+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92027\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 68.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1484246\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2020]]}, \"title\": \"Improving the performance of stream processing pipeline for vehicle data\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Gu\", \"given\": \"Wenyu\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879223\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r elektroteknik och datavetenskap (EECS)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": []}], \"abstract\": \"The growing amount of position-dependent data (containing both geo position data (i.e. latitude, longitude) and also vehicle/driver-related information) collected from sensors on vehicles poses a challenge to computer programs to process the aggregate amount of data from many vehicles.

Traditional antivirus software struggles against new malware and PDF's vast obfuscation options. In the search of better detection systems, machine learning based detectors have been developed. Although their approaches vary, some strictly examine structural features of the document whereas other examine the behavior of embedded code, they generally share high accuracy against the evaluation data they have been tested against. However, structural machine learning based PDF malware detectors have been found to be weak against targeted evasion attempts that may be found in more sophisticated malware. Such evasion attempts typically exploit knowledge of what the detection system associates with 'benign' and 'malicious' to emulate benign features or exploit a bug in the implementation, with the purpose of evading the detector. Since the introduction of such evasion attacks more structural detectors have been developed, without introducing mitigations against such evasion attacks. This thesis aggregates the existing knowledge of evasion strategies and applies them against a reproduction of a recent, not previously evasion tested, detection system and finds that it is susceptible to various evasion techniques. Additionally, the produced detector is experimentally trained with a combination of the standard data and the recently published CIC-Evasive-PDFMal2022 dataset which contains malware samples which display evasive properties. The evasive-trained detector is tested against the same set of evasion attacks.

The goal of this project is to enhance an existing wireless data access point to perform an accurate measurement of the time of arrival of a data signal from a transmitter, and to combine this information with information from additional wireless data access points to determine the location of the transmitter.\\nThere have been a number of earlier efforts in indoor location determination system using different technologies. Many of which used signal strength analysis and they have low tolerance to moving obstacles such as humans, which frequently are the most usual dynamic obstacles in indoors. In this thesis, the proposed solution utilizes time stamping and sample correlation to utilize properties of the signal waveform, which has not previously been examined by researchers other than the examiner and advisor.\\nThe main contribution of the project is a detailed analysis and design of a solution, as well as a comparison with other potential solutions. The main purpose of this solution is to increase the timing accuracy to below the duration of a single symbol. The wireless device that has been analyzed implements the IEEE 802.11b protocol. Several investigations have been done to determine the best way of extracting information from the 802.11b data frame and symbol sequence; here we utilize a correlator to determine the time of arrival of a specific sequence of symbols in a data frame. The time stamping of a stream of samples has been implemented in an Altera FPGA to get a deterministic computation time.\\nInstead of decoding the incoming I&amp;Q signals and mapping them to bits, the correlator is used to detect the unique sequence containing PSK encoded and Barker code spread scrambled ones , as this sequence always appears at the start of each data frame. The advantage of this approach is that using of samples of the waveform instead of bits gives a significant enhancement in timing resolution.\\nThe design documents of this work include detailed descriptions, simulations, and plots. A number of simulations have been done to show the timing accuracy and standard deviation, as well as comparisons with several different approaches. Several potential optimizations have also been discussed in the report.\\nSimulation code for MATLAB and implementation code for the FPGA has been included in appendices in the end of this thesis.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91993\", \"number-of-pages\": \"50\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"kth.se COS/CCS 2007-14\", \"keyword\": \"IEEE 802.11b; Correlation; Time stamping; FPGA; PSK; IEEE 802.11b; korrelation; Tidst\\u00e4mpel; FPGA; PSK\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T13:41:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T12:33:13.202+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:14:59.697+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91993\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 50.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:508801\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2010]]}, \"title\": \"Indoor Location Detection using WLAN\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Luo\", \"given\": \"Anqi\", \"localId\": \"u1cyyzn2\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Ge\", \"given\": \"Lei\", \"localId\": \"u15qrfun\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The thesis seeks to improve the accuracy of indoor wireless local area network (WLAN) location detection. The main task of the project is the design and analysis of a solution, which utilizes the packets which are already emitted by WLAN devices. The system consists of a signal receiver and signal processing. The positioning system does not transmit, thus the detection is completely passive. The result of measurements on received frames is used to calculate the WLAN transmitter's position. It does not require any transmissions, thus the detection is completely passive. The result of the measurements can be used to calculate the WLAN transmitter\\u2019s position.\\nLocation systems are more and more viewed as a necessary element of a WLAN system. Positioning accuracy is the most important issue in location system, especial in the indoor WLAN location detection. Indoor location systems are affected by indoor environment both due to multi-path and man-made effects. To resist these problems, we introduce a way to detect the arrival of the first instance of the signal by detecting the signal header. In our experiment, we timestamp the arrival of an IEEE 802.11b header. In our prototype the logic necessary to do this is implemented in an FPGA, specifically that of the Ettus Research USRP. The additional logic is quite small and might easily be added to the receiver in an access point, thus reducing the deployment cost of a location system in a real network.\\nThe proposed solution was experimentally verified. From our experiments, the detection works without requiring any changes to the hardware or software of the mobile device. By exploiting existing IEEE 802.11b transmissions the cost and difficulty of deployment is simplified due to the wide usage of IEEE 802.11b in mobile devices. Additionally, the preamble has good correlation properties making it is easy to detect the arrival of a IEEE 802.11frame. Our implementation is based upon open source hardware and software making it possible to implement this solution. A relatively low cost FPGA can be used as the correlation and timestamp circuit is rather simple (in terms of numbers of gates), making this solution feasible for commercial implementation. The method, implementation, testing, and analysis are presented in detail in the thesis.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91200\", \"number-of-pages\": \"68\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2009:209\", \"keyword\": \"WLAN; location detection accuracy; arrival signal and processing\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-11T13:08:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-09T15:03:48.435+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:28:48.072+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91200\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 68.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:861838\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2015]]}, \"title\": \"Indoor Positioning System based on Bluetooth Low Energy for Blind or Visually Impaired Users : Running on a smartphone\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Ge\", \"given\": \"Tengqingqing\", \"localId\": \"u1821p55\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Arfwedson\", \"given\": \"Henrik\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Sweden Connectivity AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Blind and visually impaired (BVI) users desire an indoor navigation tool that is inexpensive, convenient, and reliable.

Thus, one focus of this thesis is to improve the performance of an indoor positioning systems running on smartphones, as compared to existing systems. Another focus is to customize this indoor positioning system specifically for BVI users.\\u00a0 The proposed indoor positioning system is based upon Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). It consists of two parts: BLE beacons deployed in the user\\u2019s environment and an Android phone which calculates its position and provides navigation assistance by audio and vibration.Two versions of the positioning software were developed based on different algorithms. One version uses a hybrid technique combining triangulation and fingerprinting. This version achieves a positioning accuracy of 1.83 meter, and volunteers (blind-folded sighted people) took on average 91.7 seconds to complete a complex 12-meter route. The other version uses a proximity algorithm, thus it does not give as accurate positioning results. With this algorithm, a blind user was able to finish a route of 115 meters consisting of two different floors in a building including entering/exiting an elevator and multiple office doors in 4 minutes 48 seconds. The blind user found the product to be helpful and user-friendly.Finally, we draw the conclusion that a smartphone can be a good platform for a BVI navigation tool, under the condition that the algorithm is proximity based and navigation utilizes a priori information about the environment. Another insight we gained is that we should put beacons on braille signs so that blind people can find them by using the navigation app.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-175668\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii.48\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2015:230\", \"keyword\": \"RSSI-based indoor positioning; Bluetooth; smartphone; blind and visually impaired; RSSI-baserade inomhuspositionering; Bluetooth; smartphone; blinda och synskadade\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-10-19T17:33:03.836+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-10-19T13:58:12.624+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T12:06:13.760+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-175668\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 61.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511851\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2007]]}, \"title\": \"Indoor Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) : Measurement and Modeling from a user perspective\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Zandieh\", \"given\": \"Behdis\", \"localId\": \"u1u7n96l\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"If we had detailed wireless local area network (WLAN) coverage maps, both staff and equipment could be used more efficiently, for example, less time would be spent searching for connectivity.

This rapid adoption is not comparable in any other technology. Additionally, this has meant that these users have (at least some of the time) the possibility of connectivity to others and to remote services (advanced data and voice services, such as video conferences, mobile TV, navigation, and location services). Increasingly there is no longer a clear boundary between the wide area cellular network and Internet services, as the wide area cellular network is evolving from circuit switched based technologies to an IP based system; hence these wide area cellular systems are simply becoming part of the Internet. This evolution has become a challenge for the telecommunication operators, who have been used to completely controlling their network services and billing. In an attempt to maintain this traditional role for telecommunication operators, telecommunication vendors have introduced the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). A system designed to enable telecommunication operators to be able to bill the user for all of the different services accessed through the wide area cellular network. The goal of such a system is to prevent the telecommunication operators from becoming a \\\"bit pipe\\\" (i.e., simply providing \\\"commodity priced\\\" connectivity). Another relevant change that has direct impact upon this project is the role of mobile handsets as gateways between sensor networks and other networks (especially the wide area cellular networks or Internet). This has lead to integrated solutions, such as the smart house concept, mobile health monitoring, and others.\\nThis thesis project is a collaboration between Ericsson Research and SUUNTO, in which we have implemented a system for monitoring a user\\u2019s heart rate via IMS. The system (has a special focus on sports activities, but it could easily be adapted for health care) is based on internetworking sensor networks, specifically a heart rate belt that transmits data wirelessly, with the IMS network through a mobile phone or a PC. The implemented service runs on top of the SIP Presence service. This project examines two alternatives.

The second scenario is more fixed; such as a gym environment, where the sensor node communicates with a personal computer which in turn publishes the data via IMS.

The people interested in viewing this data will be able to see it through any web-browser. It will even be possible to archive, and download the data for later use by other applications.\\nThe system is not optimized yet for a truly real-time communication, as the Presence service does not offer this as other technologies (RTP, SRTP or XMPP) do. There is a big delay difference between the mobile and the fixed solution. We can say that the fixed solution is almost a real-time system for transmitting low frequency data as heart rate information.

Many different wireless technologies are available; while one technology might provide wide coverage, another provides higher bandwidth, but can only be deployed locally, even uni-directional ad-hoc links can be used to carry IP traffic. To take full advantage of the potential infrastructure, a mobile device, with multiple network interfaces, should be able to dynamically switch from one link technology to another; hopefully totally transparently to the user. Moreover, having multiple interfaces allows the device to choose, each time a new connection is established, which interface to select to route the datagrams through, based on the type of service desired.In this thesis a possible solution is presented, involving both vertical handoff optimization and policy management.

The demand for convenient financial products or services is a crucial factor in why innovative developers want to incorporate mobile money into existing financial products/services. The goal is to provide convenient financial services that enable customers to quickly send and receive money between two mobile payment platforms.The Swedish blockchain company, Centiglobe, is searching for a system whereby payments can be made conveniently between two mobile payment platforms, specifically Alipay and M PESA. This thesis sought to develop such a system by utilizing the application programming interfaces (APIs) (provided by Alipay and M PESA) coupled with Centiglobe\\u2019s blockchain to facilitate payments between an Alipay user and an M PESA user.Solving this problem began with an initial literature study of previous work related to this topic and reading the extensive API documentation provided by Alipay and Daraja Safaricom (the developers of M PESA). Next, a flowchart was created and used as a guide throughout the development of the system. Testing the system entailed integration testing. The performance of the system was determined by measuring the execution time to make a cross system payment.A one-way transfer system was developed, as Alipay users can make a payment to M PESA users but not the reverse. The results of the integration testing shows that the system is a feasible solution. The execution time of a payment shows that it is relatively quick (~9.1 seconds); thus the performance is adequate.The conclusion is that this system is a viable solution for incorporating Alipay and M PESA as mobile payment services. Moreover, the system partially facilitates person-to-person payments between them \\u2013 subject to the limitations of the Alipay API.

All objects will be connected and able to communicate with each other, while they operate in unprotected environments.

Contemporary solutions are based on security protocols such as IPSec and DTLS. These protocols are being used in an environment that extends across the Internet and into a 6LoWPAN network.

Despite situations and technologies being diverse, a well designed optimized RAN solution must adapt itself to the existing networking technologies, both with regard to legacy core networks and modern telecommunication networks in order to produce the best network which is possible subject to many constraints. There is a misconception in technical circles that an optimized internet protocol (IP) enabled RAN architecture is more theoretical than practical. On the contrary, the aforesaid is highly dependent on the technology used. Packet optimized IP- GSM Radio Access Network (GRAN) architecture is proposed in this thesis, it uses Internet Protocol (IP) rather than proprietary protocols for communication between Base Transceiver Stations (BTS), Base Station Controllers (BSC), and the Network Switching Subsystem (NSS). This architecture must deliver carrier-grade mobility, scalability, and reliability; while being optimized for efficient roaming, routing and backhauling from remote service areas. In a geographic arena that spans across the globe, classical circuit-switched networks are not cost efficient due to their integrated call control (signaling) and switching architecture. A solution to this may be soft-switching which separates the call control (Media Gateway Controller (MGC)) and switching (Media Gateway (MG)) into separate nodes. This methodology would fundamentally change the way circuit-switched services, such as traditional voice telephony, are handled. For a service provider this enables a much more efficient network, because it allows optimized equipment location for voice termination into other carrier networks. Co-location of media gateways with satellite ground stations enables local termination to the public switched telephone network (PSTN), thus offloading a great deal of the traffic from the backhaul transmission network of the mobile operator. This thesis adopts soft-switching as part of the call routing processes. The thesis considers the problem of transporting voice and signaling from-to the remote service areas, efficient routing and backhaul to the location of most suitable operator\\u2019s point of presence. The thesis explores an alternative which uses a packet switched backbone (e.g. IP based) to transport the media as close (geographically) to the dialed party as possible before terminating it at the PSTN network, thus achieving optimal routing of voice and signaling. Considering the aforesaid, the thesis describes a detailed network architecture and an operational system prototype for maritime GSM network deployment, as a befitting and challenging example of remote service area.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91940\", \"number-of-pages\": \"136\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2007-24\", \"keyword\": \"IP backbones; radio access networks; call routing; All-IP networks\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T14:16:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-22T16:39:14.648+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:15:29.857+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91940\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 136.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:541148\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1997]]}, \"title\": \"Internet Protocol Secirity\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Fujita\", \"given\": \"Lie\", \"localId\": \"u1hip3s8\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}, {\"family\": \"K\\u00f6rling (nee Beije)\", \"given\": \"Madeleine\", \"localId\": \"u1pdx3y7\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"K\\u00f6rling\", \"given\": \"Martin\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Radio Systems AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This paper gives an overview of the architecture and design of IPSec.

Many of the disadvantages of current road systems and vehicles can be removed in the future by using appropriate information and communication technology.A disadvantage that has been considered to be a major problem for many years is the fossil fuel-consumption of vehicles. Hybrid-cars and all-electric cars are being developed to reduce the use of fossil-based fuels. Since it could take a long time for these new types of vehicles to replace vehicles currently using internal combustion engines, development must also seek to improve current vehicles. Fuel-savings and safety are two major aspects that researchers and vehicle manufacturers are trying to address.One approach that provides fuel-savings is driving in a convoy. Both Scania and Volvo are currently developing this approach. They aim to achieve the same goal, but in two different ways - since they do not build upon the exact same concepts. Scania is a major manufacturer of trucks and buses, while Volvo is a major manufacturer of trucks, buses, and cars. Both are seeking to improve the fuel-savings for trucks and busses, but Volvo is also seeking to improve fuel-savings for cars.Unfortunately, with every solution are new problems. Convoy driving brings advantages, but appropriate communication between the vehicles of the convoy and those seeking to join a convoy is necessary for this approach to work well.

Traditionally, applications are developed as a monolith with one single codebase repository, and they are easily deployed; for example as Platform as a Service (PaaS). However, monolithic applications have received criticism for inefficient resource handling when deployed on the cloud; therefore, new delivery models have been introduced as alternatives. Recent research points towards Function as a Service (FaaS) to potentially solve the issue of inefficient resource handling and, therefore, reduce costs. Furthermore, since multiple distinct development strategies and delivery models exist, it becomes increasingly important to choose the right strategy from the beginning since migrating to another development strategy or deployment model in the future is rather expensive. This thesis load tests monolithic and serverless applications to determine which development approach best suits performance, scalability, and cost requirements.The findings obtained showed that an application implemented with a serverless architecture can be a better strategy if the application needs to be able to handle a sudden large up-scaling. Otherwise, both architectures showed similar results to stable workloads. Regarding costs, the serverless architecture optimized costs on a smaller scale but further analysis showed that it can surpass the costs of a monolithic architecture if it surpasses a threshold of requests per month.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-317043\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xvii,63\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2022:248\", \"keyword\": \"Cloud; Serverless; Monolithic; Load testing; Function as a service; Molnet; Serverl\\u00f6s; Monolitisk; belastningstesning; Function as a service\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-09-09T13:07:13.550+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-09-05T11:12:24.132+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-09-09T13:07:13.586+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-317043\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": \"Stockholm\", \"publisher\": \"KTH Royal Institute of Technology\", \"total_pages\": 80.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:530930\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1998]]}, \"title\": \"Investigation and Prototyping of a web based manager in a GSM SIM Application Platform\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Chabouni (nee Talbi)\", \"given\": \"Sami\", \"localId\": \"u19ke1dt\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}, {\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Almgren\", \"given\": \"Fredrik\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"AU-System\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The growing need for communication in the world has increased the use of telephony and has therefore led to several technical innovations and improvements in the field of telecommunications. As countries develop their infrastructure new ways of communicating arise. But the technical innovations do not completely guide the evolution of the infrastructure. Many times, the way people act, i.e., their mentality and traditions, decides how to invest in the infrastructure. As basic infrastructure is being built in some developing countries, others come up with new revolutionary solutions to replace old infrastructure and, for some developing countries the question arises whether to continue to invest several hundreds of millions of dollars in traditional telephony wiring. The cellular technique is revolutionary enough to be applied in countries that haven\\u2019t yet built a telephony network covering an adequate area of the country. In these countries, investments might therefore be focused on the cellular technique, rather than continuing to invest in cable networking. Thus adapting cellular technology to a worldwide distribution is necessary when it comes to administration and subscriber payment. The communication providers meet administrative obstacles when it comes to telephony services for a large-scale distribution. Will the subscribers pay for the services we offer them?\\nUsing Subscriber Identity Modules (SIM) one way to solve this problem is to define a prepaid scheme. It is based on the fact that the subscriber uses a unique identifier to make a connection and is billed using this identifier. The service provider is free to choose if the subscriber is thrustworthy or not and thus must pay in advance for the services or billed retroactively. This general way of solving administration problems does not apply only to developing countries where retroactive billing isn\\u2019t a common tradition. It is equally applicable to industrial countries where some people are banned from credibility for a couple of years because they haven\\u2019t paid their bills in time, or just because they don\\u2019t have employment at the time of their subscription application.\\nTo be in possession of a telephone is everyone\\u2019s right in most of the industrialized countries.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-96501\", \"number-of-pages\": \"49\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": \"HTTP-server; CORBA Programming; Java\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-14T08:58:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-05T10:49:22.437+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:19:38.827+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-96501\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 49.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:871975\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2015]]}, \"title\": \"Investigation of a new integration test environment : Facilitating offline debugging of Hardware-in-the-Loop\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Yang\", \"given\": \"Dekun\", \"localId\": \"u1zms893\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Gustafsson\", \"given\": \"Thomas\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Scania\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Advanced automatic testing is very important in development and research within the vehicle industry. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems give the ability to validate Electronic Control Units (ECUs) based on software simulation without gathering all of the physical hardware. This enables testing by providing inputs and examining the corresponding outputs of the ECUs in a simpler and safer way than in traditional physical testing. HIL offers the advantage that we can verify and validate the functions of ECUs prior to full-scale hardware production.On the contrary, because HIL systems are normally released as general-purpose test beds, it takes time to embed them into the current system. Additionally, the question of how to fill the gap between the HIL and the test environment is even more critical when the test bed is expected to be used for a long period of time without modifications. Furthermore, HIL systems are precious. It is not practical and will be considered as a waste of resource if it is used exclusively by testers. Scania\\u2019s RESI group uses Client-Server architecture to make it more flexible. The HIL system is hosted at server side while the testers operate it at client side. This architecture enables different implementations of client and server as long as a same protocol is applied, but this still does not solve the problem that the HIL is not always accessible when the testers want to debug their scripts. The testers want to find a solution to achieve this goal offline (without servers).To solve the problem, we first investigated which programming languages are used in the industry. Without doubt, there is no dominant language that ideally suits all situations, so secondly, we developed a new test environment. The new environment including \\u201cDummy Mode\\u201d and \\u201cMat Mode\\u201d is able to provide script validation service on basic and logic levels without servers. The result shows the Dummy mode is able to reach a higher detection rate (99.3%) on simple errors comparing to the current environment (81.3%). By reproducing and reusing the result of HIL system, Mat mode is able to identify logic errors and provide better assistance when the logic errors are found. In general, the proposed environment is able to show a better way of using HIL which makes the whole system more efficient and productive.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-177199\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,50\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2015:236\", \"keyword\": \"Hardware in the Loop; test environment; Python; declarative test script; imperative test script; Simulink; MATLAB; Hardware In the Loop; Testmilj\\u00f6; Python; Deklarativ programmering; Imperativ programmering; Simulink; MATLAB\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-12-08T13:01:00.863+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-11-17T13:29:53.850+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T11:41:47.965+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-177199\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 63.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:508254\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2010]]}, \"title\": \"Investigation of home router security\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Karamanos\", \"given\": \"Emmanouil\", \"localId\": \"u1pzp7gl\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Seifert\", \"given\": \"Jean-Pierre\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Technische Universit\\u00e4t Berlin\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Home routers are common in every household that has some kind of Internet connectivity.

Today many modern, real-time applications, such as high performance and high quality graphics can be combined with a Xbox Kinect to do object tracking and Google Glass to provide a heads up display. These applications can also be combined with other sensors and actuators to produce monitoring systems that can give facilities' operators \\\"telepresence\\\" throughout a facility. To be able to computationally interpret movement or patterns in an image it is imperative to investigate the application of this technology.The research conducted at Xylem has focused on a very specific problem: How can pattern recognition be utilized to dynamically determine the volume and depth of water in a sump at a pumping station. The equipment currently used to determine the water level depends upon being either below or alongside the water's surface, this puts the equipment under great stress due to the nature of a pumping station. Xylem is one of the leading global water technology companies, hence sewage-pumps are one of its main products. The main equipment utilized in this thesis project consists of a camera attached to the interior at the top of the sump in a pumping station connected to a computer.The software developed includes a simple graphical user interface (GUI). This GUI was implemented in C# and is designed to continuously collect data from a camera for subsequent analysis. Our algorithm utilizes anti-correlation between many images taken during a short interval to determine the actual water level. The known dimensions of the sump are then used to calculate the volume of water.Most of the depth values produced by our software were correct and we were able to correctly estimate the water level with an error of less than 4 cm, this corresponds to a volume error of 62 liters for a 140 cm wide sump. Our algorithm was able to monitor the depth over time inside a pumping station in a simulated live environment.\\u00a0 This accuracy is obtained with a time window of 1 second. The results of this system are important because it shows that it is possible to use a camera to measure water depth. This provides pump owners and operators with valuable information regarding the current state of the pump, both in terms of current water depth and an image of possible anomalies such as the presence of foreign objects in the sump.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-149256\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xi,95\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2014:115\", \"keyword\": \"Pattern recognition; water level estimation; m\\u00f6nsterigenk\\u00e4nning; vattenniv\\u00e5 uppskattning\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-08-19T08:50:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-08-18T15:47:39.257+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T19:03:15.555+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-149256\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 106.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:510473\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2009]]}, \"title\": \"IP Multimedia for Municipalities : The supporting architecture\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Peterstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Dan\", \"localId\": \"u1cwceql\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Ljungberg\", \"given\": \"Per\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Fiber deployment is becoming popular and is seen as a way to increase a community\\u2019s attractiveness to new inhabitants and companies.

This report describes how to control and monitor home appliances over IPv6 by using existing home automation hardware and an Internet connected gateway.\\nThere are many commercial home automation systems available. However, these are often proprietary and/or designed for limited use. This project seeks to pave the way for IP-enabling home appliances, making such devices part of the Internet. Therefore, these devices can individually be controlled both from within the home and remotely. Internet enabling each of these devices eliminates the need for special Internet connected control units, simplifying home automation and hopefully giving yet another incentive to deploy IPv6 on a larger scale. The practical goal of this project has been to create a virtual, but practically usable, IPv6 home automation system. This has been done using existing simple home automation hardware tied to a gateway relaying uniquely addressed IPv6 command messages to the appropriate device. This gateway's only function will be to translate IPv6 commands to whatever interface the device being controlled is using (this includes translating to and from the appropriate link and physical layers). Using this platform, new applications can be created by enabling the devices to interact without relying on a central control node.

This is a consequence of several ongoing changes of the Internet. Different regions of the world are in different phases of their rollout of IPv6, making intercommunication increasingly challenging. Copyright legislation has caught up with ICT technology, but differences in licensing agreements may very from nation to nation which often hinders content being accessed beyond borders. Finally, several high-profile government attempts have been made to enforce stringent censorship of data.Therefore, we believe that a demand exists for simple consumer-oriented technologies for proxying and tunneling data between separate regions of the Internet. Furthermore, we believe that this demand will increase dramatically during the coming years. A key success factor for this next generation of proxies will be the ability to handle multicast IPv6 packets, as these packets represent the most probable distribution method for IPTV in the future.This thesis examines the challenges presented by IPv6 multicast-routing in the context of constructing a proxy. It also presents a best-practice solution to the problem of designing, implementing, and utilizing such a proxy. The thesis also contains a review of current IPv6 multicast routing technology. Several implementations are benchmarked against each other, with the goal of building a prototype for a consumer-oriented IPv6 multicast proxy. The prototype is presented and was tested. These tests demonstrate the functionality of the prototype proxy and reveal areas where the prototype could be improved.

One of the use cases of visualization is to graphically represent and compare simulation results. At Ericsson Research, a visualization platform, based on JavaFX 2 is used to visualize simulation results. Three configuration files are required in order to create an application based on the visualization tool: XML, FXML, and CSS.The current problem is that, in order to set up a visualization application, the three configuration files must be written by hand which is a very tedious task. The purpose of this study is to reduce the amount of work which is required to construct a visualization application by providing a serialization function which makes it possible to save the layout (FXML) of the application at run-time based solely on the scene graph.In this master\\u2019s thesis, possible frameworks that might ease the implementation of a generic FXML serialization have been investigated and the most promising alternative according to a number of evaluation metrics has been identified. Then, using a design science research method, an algorithm is proposed which is capable of generic object/bean serialization to FXML based on a number of features or requirements. Finally, the implementation results are evaluated through a set of test cases. The evaluation is composed of an analysis of the serialization results &amp; tests and a comparison of the expected result and the actual results using unit testing and test coverage measurements.Evaluation results for each serialization function show that the results of the serialization are similar to the original files and hence the proposed algorithm provides the desired serialization functionality for the specific features of FXML needed for this platform, provided that the tests considered every aspect of the serialization functionality.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-131221\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,74\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:232\", \"keyword\": \"Scene graph; Java bean; JavaFX; FXML; serialization; reflection; introspection; DOM; tree traversal; scengraf; Java-b\\u00f6nor; JavaFX; FXML; serialisering; reflection; introspection; DOM; tr\\u00e4d traversering\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-10-10T07:34:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-10-09T17:16:16.686+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T22:50:01.618+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-131221\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 87.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:224297\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2009]]}, \"title\": \"Jitter Management in Circuit Switched Voice over HSPA Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Song\", \"given\": \"Ge\", \"affiliation\": []}], \"supervisor\": null, \"abstract\": \"When a shared channel or packet switched network is used for transmission (e.g.WLAN, HSPA (Turbo-3G), LTE (4G)), it introduces variance in the delay of packets. Thisvariance is called jitter. This jitter can lead to significant degradation of quality inreal-time services if it is not properly handled.\\nHigh Speed Packet Access (HSPA) is an extension to the third Generation W-CDMAcellular network that provides significantly increased bandwidth and network capacity byintroducing a High Speed-Downlink Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) for downlink and anEnhanced-Dedicated Channel (E-DCH) for uplink. Both HS-DSCH and E-DCH usere-transmissions in order to ensure a low block error rate, as a result jitter is induced inboth channels. Moreover, HS-DSCH also uses channel dependent scheduling betweenusers adding additional jitter.\\nSince HSPA uses IP and the voice service is provided by voice over IP (VoIP), jittermanagement is performed at the destination end-point. However, 3GPP has also specifiedtransportation of circuit switched voice over HSPA (CSoHS), where jitter managementneeds to be performed separately, at both the entry point to the core network and in thereceiving end-point as jitter is introduced both in the uplink and downlink.\\nThis report studies CSoHS, with a focus on its delay and jitter characteristics. Itintroduces two schemes for jitter management: a fixed jitter buffer and an adaptive jitterbuffer. These jitter buffer designs are evaluated mainly by looking at the jitter loss (i.e.,the proportion of packets that have to be discarded because they exceed the maximumpermitted jitter) and the buffering time. The results show that the adaptive jitter buffer canachieve better performance in balancing the trade-off between jitter loss and bufferingdelay when dealing with various network conditions. In contrast, the fix jitter buffer is notcapable of tracking variations in the network conditions, as the performance of the fixedjitter buffer is determined solely by the configuration of the initial buffer level. Theadaptive jitter buffer is able to consistently provide equal or better quality of service thanthe fixed jitter buffer.i\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-10673\", \"number-of-pages\": \"viii, 65\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2009-06-17T13:53:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2009-06-17T13:41:00.409+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-25T06:57:57.391+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-10673\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 73.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:514748\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2003]]}, \"title\": \"Key Agreement for Secure Voice over IP\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Bilien\", \"given\": \"Johan\", \"localId\": \"u1ai4xjb\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Eliasson\", \"given\": \"Erik\", \"localId\": \"u130e4ad\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Vatn\", \"given\": \"Jon-Olov\", \"localId\": \"u1op1pjc\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This thesis reviews the usual properties and requirements for key agreement protocols.

For sound, digital music enables digital distribution, ease of sharing, and large amounts of storage. But, despite the recent efforts by Internet companies and publishers, the book industry has resisted success in the digital era.Today, new technologies enable us to distribute digital books. However, these digitised books are still represented in a traditional: as text and static images. However, our project is based on the believe that ones reading experience can evolve and benefit from current technology.The \\\"Leaf\\\" project's main objective is to create an electronic publication distribution platform that can equally satisfy publishers, writers, and readers. The project will create an environment to distribute digital publications that support more advanced technologies, providing in the future something beyond text and static images to the reader.This document describes the different aspects of design of an information technology infrastructure designed to stream electronic publications. This part of the \\\"Leaf\\\" projects aims to describe the necessary information technology infrastructure needed as an electronic publication distribution platform. The main purpose of this infrastructure is to serve electronic publications on-line to readers; however, that is not the only objective for this infrastructure.

The Internet of Things describes a scenario where Internet connected devices are ubiquitous and even the smallest device has a connection to the Internet. Many of these devices will be running on constrained platforms with limited power and computing resources. Implementing protocols that are both secure and resource efficient is challenging. Current protocols have generally been designed for mains powered devices; hence, they are not optimized for running on constrained devices. The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a protocol for network communication specifically designed for constrained devices. This thesis project examines CoAP and presents an extension that adds authentication in a way that is suitable for constrained devices, with respect to minimizing resource use. The proposed solution has been compared and contrasted with other alternatives for authentication, particularly those alternatives used with CoAP. It has also been implemented in code and experimentally evaluated with regards to performance versus vanilla CoAP.The main goal of this project is to implement a lightweight authentication extension for CoAP to be deployed and evaluated on constrained devices. This extension, called Short Message Authentication ChecK (SMACK), can be used on devices that require a method for secure authentication of messages while using only limited power. The main goal of the extension is to protect against battery exhaustion and denial of sleep attacks. Other benefits are that the extension adds no additional overhead when compared with the packet structure described in the latest CoAP specification. Minimizing overhead is important since some constrained networks may only support low bandwidth communication.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-156185\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,54\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2014:136\", \"keyword\": \"Constrained Application Protocol; CoAP; Internet of Things; message authentication; constrained devices; Contiki; Short Message Authentication Check; SMACK; Constrained Application Protocol; CoAP; Internet of Things; meddelandeautentisering; begr\\u00e4nsade plattformar; Contiki; Short Message Authentication Check; SMACK\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-12-30T14:59:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-11-24T11:16:13.177+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T17:13:04.959+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-156185\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 67.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:530129\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1998]]}, \"title\": \"Linjelyssnare f\\u00f6r Gr\\u00e4nssnitt mot DECT-basestation\", \"language\": \"swe\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Ebrahimi\", \"given\": \"Hamid\", \"localId\": \"u1ojgvbm\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}, {\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Andersson\", \"given\": \"Lennart\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson (EBC)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"There purpose of this thesis was design and evaluate a device which would listen to the proprietary interface between a Private Automatic Branch Exchange (PBX) and a Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) basestation.

The data about the amount of traffic was measured using a real-time tra\\ufb03c-monitoring tool from PacketLogic. Traffic from the monitored network to various destinations was captured and classified into 5 ring-wise locality levels in accordance with the traffic\\u2019s geographic destinations: traffic within Network North and traffic to the remainder of the North of Sweden, Sweden, Europe, and World.Parameters such as traffic patterns (e.g., traffic volume distribution, application usage, and application popularity) and user behavior (e.g., usage habits, user interests, etc.) at different geographic localities were studied in this project. As a result of a systematic and in-depth measurement and the fact that the number of content servers at the World, Europe, and Sweden levels are quite large, we recommend that an intelligent content distribution system be positioned at Level 1 localities in order to reduce the amount of duplicate traffic in the network and thereby removing this traffic load from the core network.The results of these measurements provide a temporal reference for ISPs of their present traffic and should allow them to better manage their network. However, due to certain circumstances the analysis was limited due to the set of available daily traffic traces. To provide a more trustworthy solution, a relatively longer-term, periodic, and seasonal traffic analysis could be done in the future based on the established measurement framework.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-107686\", \"number-of-pages\": \"53\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:302\", \"keyword\": \"Traffic Measurement; Geographical Locality; Traffic Pattern; User Behavior; Application Utilization; Internet Trafik; Geografiska Trafikdestinationer; Trafikm\\u00f6nster; Anv\\u00e4ndarbeteenden; Applikationer Popularitet\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-12-17T08:16:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-12-14T18:35:05.018+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T02:04:50.600+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-107686\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 53.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:515030\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2003]]}, \"title\": \"Location Aware Communication\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Eckerstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Johan\", \"localId\": \"u1nw6gc8\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Asplund\", \"given\": \"Lars-\\u00c5ke\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Columna AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Automotive telematic systems will be as common in future cars as ABS and airbags are in current cars.

About 60,000, licensed (age 15 and up, about 50%) and younger actively played soccer in Stockholm in 2005. That is roughly 24% of the total number of participants in sports activities in Stockholm\\u2019s district. There is a need for a location-based application (commonly abbreviated \\\"app\\\") to help people spontaneously meet for different sports activities.The app developed and analyzed in this thesis will address this need and assist potential participants in organizing sports activities, deciding to participate in these activities, make friends, etc. Not only large team sports will be considered, but sports done in pairs such as tennis and other sports as well that you do with others. Consider a person who has moved to a new city and wants to play football (soccer), but does not know people in this city. This app can help this person find others who would like to play in a quick and easy way by looking at a map and seeing where others would like to participate in this sport, for example at a particular soccer field, using location information concerning the potential participants and this specific field. Apps that use location information have become very common with the widespread use of smartphones. Such an app provides a location-based service.This thesis describes the design and implementation of an Android app with a location-based service and how to set up this app, what technology is needed to get the needed location information, and the programming language used. In addition, the thesis considers users\\u2019 needs and how the app caters to those needs. An analysis will be done of how well this app communicates with a database server as the number of users increases, scales. Performance and load on both the server and app will be considered. The performance will be analyzed to see how well it matches the users\\u2019 expectations.The app developed in this thesis will be for the Android platform and Apple's iOS (but the focus in the thesis is on the Android-version). This app will communicate with a database server running a Linux OS, an Apache HTTP server, a MySQL database, and using a PHP programming web infrastructure (such a setup of services is commonly called by the acronym LAMP). The app will connect to Facebook and Twitter to exchange information (however, that is outside the scope of this thesis).\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-160260\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,42\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2015:10\", \"keyword\": \"Location-based; application; app; service; Android; scales; database; server; LAMP; sports; Platsbaserad; application; app; tj\\u00e4nst; Android; skalar; databas; server; LAMP; sport\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-03-24T13:19:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-02-18T12:45:10.412+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T15:57:22.059+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-160260\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 55.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:513062\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2005]]}, \"title\": \"Low cost secure network connectivity for a municipal organization\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Gutti\", \"given\": \"Krishna\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Finnved\", \"given\": \"Johan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"AB STOKAB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) based on 802.11 technology were initially conceived with the aim of providing wireless connectivity to client devices in limited areas, such as office buildings, homes, etc. or in places where wires are too expensive to be placed. This \\u2018anywhere\\u2019 connectivity is said to have improved worker\\u2019s productivity by allowing one to work flexibly from various places besides one\\u2019s desk. Currently we are witnessing the growth of both public and private networks based on WLAN technology. Such hotspots are usually limited to the network owner\\u2019s premises such as her office, campus, etc. This limits the total coverage area of this network. It is often not economically feasible for a network access provider to install Access Points at all places that a network user might go. This has become a problem for many network access providers; a sensible solution would be to collectively address the problem by entering into roaming agreements as is already done by most Wide Area Wireless Network providers. Such operator specific roaming agreements can provide nearly continuous coverage over a much wider area such as an entire city. One of the goals of this project was to study potential cost effective technical solutions that provide WLAN access to City of Stockholm\\u2019s network based on 802.11 technologies; including evaluation from different technical aspects (e.g., capacity enhancements, improvements in handover latency, etc). Proper deployment and management strategies were also evaluated. Technologies permitting differentiated services for users, enabling provisioning of Voice over Wireless Local Area Network (VoWLAN) services and other interactive services were studied. Technologies for authentication, authorization and accounting were studied. Additionally technical means of providing secure access to the wireless network were investigated. Evaluation of architectures that allow inter-operator roaming were made.Today\\u2019s corporate users are increasingly mobile and there is a need to provide secure access to corporate data to these mobile users. The coverage offered by WLAN networks even with large roaming agreements would still have coverage gaps which can be reduced by relying on the 3G networks which are being widely deployed. Virtual Private Network technologies are successfully used for providing secure remote access to data and Mobile IP technology provides application persistence to mobile users even while switching between networks (e.g., WLAN to 3G). There is a need for them to co-exist in order to provide secure, mobile access to data. Such secure mobile access could also be provided without relying on the above, standardised solutions. A goal of this master\\u2019s thesis was to evaluate the technical solutions to enable such secure, mobile access to data. Current products were evaluated and a suggestion of suitable products for the City of Stockholm was given.The above solutions together would provide the City of Stockholm with secure wireless network connectivity[.]\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92266\", \"number-of-pages\": \"66\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-IMIT-LCN.

Thus, mobile network operators need to find a solution for how to support the growing amounts of traffic at fixed revenue per user. Similarly, the number of roaming users has increased, but according to recent European Union (EU) regulations, mobile network operators have to lower their charges for roaming to zero by June 2017. While this decrease in roaming charges will benefit European roaming users, mobile network operators have to cover their expenses for their own roaming subscribers, thus they have to find a way to lower their operational expenses (OPEX). Additionally, it is important for operators to consider how they might actually benefit from the removal of roaming charges.This project will focus on roaming in 4th generation (4G) mobile networks. A common roaming scenario would include three different networks: the Home Public Land Mobile Network (HPLMN) a transit network, and a Visited Public Land Mobile Network (VPLMN). Normally, both the signaling traffic and the media payloads traverse these networks, thus causing additional latencies and increasing OPEX. However, in recent years, a new mechanism, called local breakout (LBO), was introduced that can lower the costs of roaming and avoid unnecessary traffic while meeting a roaming user's needs.The goal of LBO is to decrease the operator's OPEX when supporting roaming subscribers. A secondary goal of LBO is to reduce the latencies experienced by roaming subscribers during their sessions. Achieving both of these goals will satisfy both operators and consumers.This thesis project analyzes Voice over Long Term Evolution roaming with the aim of presenting the various alternative architectures for Voice over LTE roaming, compare them in different scenarios, and evaluating them based on criteria defined during this project. The conclusion is that the best solution that is applicable to all the mobile network operators for all the possible roaming scenarios does not exist yet. The various VoLTE roaming architectures can be chosen by the mobile network providers according to their needs.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-200335\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiv, 52\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2017:1\", \"keyword\": \"Local breakout; RAVEL; S8HR; VoLTE roaming; Local breakout; RAVEL; S8HR; VoLTE roaming\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-02-01T13:51:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-02-01T13:51:56.559+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-27T03:37:22.314+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-200335\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 66.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:531073\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1998]]}, \"title\": \"Making the communication network aware of the user's location\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Jansson\", \"given\": \"Christian\", \"localId\": \"u1kx92jw\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Frisk\", \"given\": \"Claes\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ellemtel\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This thesis report discusses and summarises the concerns for making the communication network location aware.

These decentralized systems are preferable to centralized systems for many reasons, specifically they are more reliable and more resource efficient. Decentralized systems are more effective in the area of information management in the case when the data is distributed across multiple peers and maintained in a synchronized manner. This data synchronization is the main requirement for information management systems deployed in a decentralized environment, especially when data/information is needed for monitoring purposes or some dependent data artifacts rely upon this data. In order to ensure a consistent and cohesive synchronization of dependent/derived data in a decentralized environment, a dependency management system is needed.\\nIn a dependency management system, when one chunk of data relies on another piece of data, the resulting derived data artifacts can use a decentralized systems approach but must consider several critical issues, such as how the system behaves if any peer goes down, how the dependent data can be recalculated, and how the data which was stored on a failed peer can be recovered. In case of a churn (resulting from failing peers), how does the system adapt the transmission of data artifacts with respect to their access patterns and how does the system provide consistency management?\\nThe major focus of this thesis was to addresses the churn behavior issues and to suggest and evaluate potential solutions while ensuring a load balanced network, within the scope of a dependency information management system running in a decentralized network. Additionally, in peer-to-peer (P2P) algorithms, it is a very common assumption that all peers in the network have similar resources and capacities which is not true in real world networks. The peer\\u201fs characteristics can be quite different in actual P2P systems; as the peers may differ in available bandwidth, CPU load, available storage space, stability, etc. As a consequence, peers having low capacities are forced to handle the same computational load which the high capacity peers handle, resulting in poor overall system performance. In order to handle this situation, the concept of utility based replication is introduced in this thesis to avoid the assumption of peer equality, enabling efficient operation even in heterogeneous environments where the peers have different configurations. In addition, the proposed protocol assures a load balanced network while meeting the requirement for high data availability, thus keeping the distributed dependent data consistent and cohesive across the network. Furthermore, an implementation and evaluation in the PeerfactSim.KOM P2P simulator of an integrated dependency management framework, D4M, was done.\\nIn order to benchmark the implementation of proposed protocol, the performance and fairness tests were examined. A conclusion is that the proposed solution adds little overhead to the management of the data availability in a distributed data management systems despite using a heterogeneous P2P environment. Additionally, the results show that the various P2P clusters can be introduced in the network based on peer\\u201fs capabilities.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95220\", \"number-of-pages\": \"62\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:60\", \"keyword\": \"heterogeneous peer-to-peer networks; dependency management framework; p2p Replication protocol; Dynamic Distributed derived data management system(D4M); p2p churn\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-14T14:35:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-05-20T02:10:18.031+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:34:35.857+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95220\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 62.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:516834\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2000]]}, \"title\": \"MANETv6 : Mobile Ad hoc Networks with IPv6\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Jondring\", \"given\": \"Cecilia\", \"localId\": \"u1bfgion\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Stefanidis\", \"given\": \"Katerina\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Johansson\", \"given\": \"Per\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericssson Research, Switchlab\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Today\\u2019s Internet Protocol version 4, IPv4, has been in use since the early 1980\\u2019s and is now becoming obsolete in many ways. New networks and IP devices are constantly being attached to the Internet and the number of IP addresses is running out. The next generation Internet protocol, Internet protocol version 6 (IPv6), will allow for the continued expansion of the Internet and will replace IPv4 in the near future. Another reason for developing a new Internet protocol was to bring new functionality and higher performance into networking based on operational experience with IPv4.\\nMobile ad hoc networks are wireless, mobile networks that can be set up anywhere and anytime. Nodes in such a network can communicate beyond transmitter range by supporting multihop communication through IP routing. The network topology may change rapidly and therefore the routing functionality in an ad hoc network is different from that in an ordinary fixed IP network. Ad hoc networking can be applied in many situations, supporting applications, such as mobile conferencing outside the office. A stand-alone ad hoc network is useful in itself, but would be even more useful connected to the Internet.\\nIn this thesis we have investigated and analyzed how IPv6 may affect mobile ad hoc networking. Our focus has been on the IP address autoconfiguration of nodes in an ad hoc network and how the new features in IPv6 will enable a simpler way to provide Internet access to ad hoc networks. The purpose was to not use Mobile IPv6 in our solution. The solution could therefore be applied to all nodes, even to those not using Mobile IPv6. The existing solutions of how to connect an ad hoc network to the Internet are all based on Mobile IP.

At the same time, due to their decreasing price they are becoming more and more attractive and available to the average customer. This has lead to the development of many new applications for such portable electronic devices. Mobile devices tend to have increasing local resources in terms of memory/storage and CPU [2]. Despite these improvements in hardware attributes, there are still limitations that characterize these portable devices and which have not improved as quickly as the increase of the local computational power. These limitations mostly concern the network resources and battery power that are both still rather poor. Thus the main barriers for mobile nodes are network resources and limiting the power consumption of the device itself. Today, wireless networks provide limited reliability and less bandwidth than fixed networks. Moreover, all mobile nodes are highly energy dependent as they use batteries with a limited capacity. Additionally, roaming is a feature that increasingly must be supported for such wireless devices, as their physical portability leads to users to use them even as they move about. This may require the utilization of different wireless networks while the node is on the move. Therefore, for all the above reasons there is a demand for the development of intelligent mechanisms and techniques for optimizing the management of these limited resources, while exploiting the local resources, thus providing users with the best possible performance within the available resources.\\nAt the present, there are operating systems, such as the Symbian OS [22], specially designed for supporting advanced features in mobile computing. However, there is still development to be done. Moreover, although there are many new applications for mobile computing, they are not yet sophisticated enough to cope with changes in the wireless environment, these changes occur due to the node\\u2019s change in context. This creates a gap that should be filled by software between the applications and the operating system; this is frequently called middleware.

The Internet is a network of networks with a myriad of computer devices, including smartphones, game consoles (handheld/stationary), IP televisions, tablet computers, laptop computers, desktop computers, palmtop computers, etc.\\nThis network of computers flourishes because of careful planning and maintenance by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), backbone network operators, and others. An additional factor that enables the Internet to operate is the four logical layers of abstraction in the TCP/IP protocol stack. One of these layers is the layer responsible for the transfer of datagrams/packets from one host to another. This layer is known as the Internet Protocol (IP) layer. However, as originally conceived a 32 bit address was thought to be more than enough. The space of IP addresses was distributed among different regions rather disproportionately, driven largely by the numbers of addresses that were requested (ordered in time). Today after a series of inventions in the field (such as the world wide web) and a rapid growth in the number of devices that wish to connect to the Internet the available unassigned address space has largely been depleted.\\nRegions with large populations, but with few assigned blocks of IP addresses have begun to exhaust all their assigned addresses, while other regions face the same fate in a few months. The need for a larger address space was predicted years ago and the next generation addressing scheme was devised as part of the development of Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6). Countries such as China and India had few IPv4 addresses and they have been forced to transition to IPv6 rather quickly. Today a significant number of the users in these countries are unable to communicate over IPv4 networks. The purpose of this thesis project is to discuss the transition to IPv6 and the transition to this new addressing scheme. IPv6 provides a much larger address space, along with a number of additional improvements in comparison to the previous version of IP (i.e., IPv4). Despite the advantages of adopting IPv6, the incentive to transition is low amongst well established businesses, especially those in regions that received a considerable number of IPv4 addresses initially. Instead different techniques have been employed in these places to mitigate the problem of IPv4 address exhaustion. It is also probable that this reluctance is a way to keep competing businesses out of the market for a while longer. This thesis aims to facilitate the transition from IPv4 to IPv6.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-96355\", \"number-of-pages\": \"32\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:71\", \"keyword\": \"Internet; IPv6; IPv4; IPv6 deployment; IPv4 to IPv6 transition strategies; Mobile IPv6; Performance evaluation\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-14T10:59:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-02T02:19:01.920+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:21:44.386+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-96355\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 32.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:627307\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2013]]}, \"title\": \"Minding the spectrum gaps : First steps toward developing a distributed white space sensor grid for cognitive radios\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Lara Peinado\", \"given\": \"Javier\", \"localId\": \"u1733y14\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The idea that the radio spectrum is growing ever more scarce has become commonplace, and is being reinforced by the recent bidding wars among telecom operators. New wireless applications tend to be deployed in the relatively narrow unlicensed frequency bands, worsening the problem of interference for all users.\\u00a0 However, not all frequency bands are in use in every location all the time, creating temporal and spatial gaps (also known as white spaces) that cognitive radio systems aim to take advantage of. In order to achieve that, such systems need to be able to constantly scan large chunks of the radio spectrum to keep track of which frequency bands are locally available any given moment, thus allowing users to switch to one of these unoccupied frequency bands once the current band becomes unusable (or less useful). This requirement of wideband sensing capabilities often translates into the need to install specialized radio components, raising the costs of such systems, and is often at odds with the focus on monitoring the current band as is done by traditional wireless devices.The goal of this master\\u2019s thesis project is to simplify cognitive radio systems by shifting the wideband sensing functionality to a specialized and inexpensive embedded platforms that will act as a white space sensor, thus freeing cognitive radio users from this task and making it easier to integrate dynamic spectrum management techniques into existing systems. To do that a wireless sensor gateway platform developed by a previous master\\u2019s thesis has been repurposed as a prototype white space detector and tested against several wireless transmitters.\\u00a0 The aim is to develop a standalone platform that can be deployed all around an area to collect data that can be used to create a geographical map of the use of the spectrum. Such a system should require as little maintenance as possible, thus auto-update and self-configuring features have been implemented in the detector, as well as a simple scanning protocol that allows for remote configuration of the wideband sensing parameters. Furthermore, a basic server has been developed to aggregate and display the data provided by the different sensors.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-123548\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xv,58\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:102\", \"keyword\": \"cognitive radio; cooperative spectrum sensing; energy detector; kognitiv radio; kooperativa spektrum avk\\u00e4nning; energi detektor\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-06-11T14:17:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-06-11T14:02:32.402+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T00:09:39.335+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-123548\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 73.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:565706\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"MiniSIP as a Plug-in\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Arumugam Mathivanan\", \"given\": \"Arun\", \"localId\": \"u1qbtr2y\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Internet telephony has rapidly becoming an integral part of life. Due to its low incremental cost and the wide availability of voice over IP (VoIP) based services these services being used by nearly everyone. Today there are many VoIP applications available in the market, but most of them lack basic security features. Because people use VoIP services via public hotspots and shared local area networks these VoIP applications are vulnerable to attacks, such as eavesdropping. Today, there is a great need for VoIP applications with high quality security.MiniSIP is an open-source VoIP application platform, initially developed at KTH. High quality security has been a major focus of MiniSIP developments by several students, including the first public implementations of the secure real-time protocol (SRTP) and the Multimedia Key Exchange (MIKEY) protocol. MiniSIP implements secure end-to-end VoIP services. In addition, MiniSIP implements features such as dynamically choosing the most appropriate CODEC during a call, implementing calling policies, etc. However, it suffers from having a complicated GUI that requires the use of many libraries, rendering it both hard to build and hard support \\u2013 both of which make it unsuitable for commercial purposes.Web browser plug-ins are shared libraries that users install to extend the functionality of their browser. For example, a plug-in can be used to display content that the browser itself cannot display natively. For example, Adobe's reader plugin displays PDF files directly within the web browser. Real Network\\u2019s Streaming video player utilizes a browser plug-in to provide support for live video streaming within a web page. Adobe\\u2019s Flash player plugin is required to load or view any Flash contents \\u2013 such as video or animations.The goal of this thesis project is remove the problem of the existing MiniSIP GUIs by developing a Firefox browser plug-in for the MiniSIP application that will utilize a web-browser based GUI. The prototype that will be designed, implemented, and evaluated will implement an open-source VoIP application that is easy for a Firefox browser user to install and will be easy to use via a web interface. The long term goal is to facilitate an ordinary user to utilize VoIP communication via their web browser. A secondary goal is to re-use the code within MiniSIP, while using the web-browser to provide the GUI.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-104646\", \"number-of-pages\": \"45\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:247\", \"keyword\": \"VoIP; MiniSIP; Firefox plugin; web-browser; VoIP; MiniSIP; Firefox plugin; webbl\\u00e4sare\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-11-14T16:38:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-11-08T12:40:47.138+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T02:39:20.770+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-104646\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 45.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:519245\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"MIPMANET : Mobile IP for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"J\\u00f6nsson\", \"given\": \"Ulf\", \"localId\": \"u15mhiy5\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Alriksson\", \"given\": \"Fredrik\", \"localId\": \"u1m6jply\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Mobile ad hoc networking allows nodes to form temporary networks and communicate beyond transmitter range by supporting multihop communication through IP routing. Routing in such ten reactive, i.e., performed on-demand, as opposed to Internet routing that is proactive. As ad hoc networks are formed on a temporary basis, no assumptions are made about the IP addresses of the participating nodes; nodes may use any address. Because of these characteristics, it is not straightforward to connect an ad hoc network to the Internet. In this Master's thesis we have studied how an ad hoc network, in which on-demand routing is used and where nodes with arbitrary IP addresses may appear, can be connected to the Internet. Various ways of adapting Mobile IP to such an ad hoc network have also been explored. All this has resulted in the MIPMANET proposal.\\nMIPMANET provides Internet access by using Mobile IP with foreign agent care-of addresses and reverse tunneling. By using Mobile IP, nodes are routable regardless of which network they are currently located in and by using reverse tunneling the requirements on the ad hoc routing protocol in use are kept at a minimum. Also, by using an interworking unit between the foreign agent and the ad hoc network no modifications to Mobile IP have to be made outside of the ad hoc network. MIPMANET also provides transparent interaction between Mobile IP and the ad hoc routing protocol.\\nTo allow analysis of the MIPMANET proposal, we have implemented it in Network Simulator 2 (ns). The Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) Routing protocol has been used for routing within the ad hoc network. To illustrate the effects of different design choices and to form the basis of future evaluations, we have also performed some simulations. These simulations show that the ability to choose the closest gateway to the Internet is highly valuable.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93726\", \"number-of-pages\": \"89\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": \"MIPMANET; Mobile Ad Hoc Networks; Internet Access; Mobile IP; AODV\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-20T14:17:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-24T16:19:50.985+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:46:59.783+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93726\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 89.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:515356\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2003]]}, \"title\": \"Mobil Positionering med Kartst\\u00f6d\", \"language\": \"swe\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Coyet\", \"given\": \"Peter\", \"localId\": \"u1sgdwgc\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Djavaherian\", \"given\": \"Kaveh\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"SL Infrateknik AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This master thesis was conducted on behalf of SL Infrateknik AB.

The staff at Sony Ericsson has major difficulties determining where the origin of a problem is. They often simply know that something is not working. The major effort is often to detect the source of the actual problem rather than solving it.The PlayNow service provided by Sony Ericsson will be used as a reference service in this master\\u2019s thesis project.

This application acts as a proxy server and allows the browser to call methods exposed by the local Java APIs. Both the benefits and some security concerns of this approach are examined.

With advancements in embedded systems and the introduction of electric controls in the automotive industry, the design of complex electric systems for the vehicles has become one of the major design challenges. In the commercial truck industry, the development cycles are almost a decade long. Therefore, it is a big challenge to introduce a new architecture to accommodate the modern automotive technologies in the upcoming generation of trucks.Currently, the commercial truck industry relies highly on a federated electrical/electronic (E/E) architecture. In this architecture, Electronic Control Units (ECU) are responsible for computation and Input/Output operations. These ECUs are clustered into different domains based on their respective functions. However, these domains are not isolated from each other. These modules communicate with each other using a vehicular network, which is typically a controller area network in the current trucks.In the automotive industry, automation is increasing at a fast pace. As the level of automation increases, the need for high computation also increases, which increases the overall costs. This study aims to address this problem by introducing an integrated E/E architecture where all the computational power is concentrated at one place (or perhaps two or three places to allow for redundancy). This study proposes to introduce a lowcost replacement for the current ECUs with more limited computational power but with generic input/output interfaces.This thesis provides the reader with some background of the current E/E architecture of commercial trucks and introduces the reader to ECUs. Additionally, the relevant network architectures and protocols are explained. A potential solution, based upon the centralized computation based E/E architecture and its implementation are discussed followed by a detailed analysis of the replacements for ECUs. The result of this analysis, if adopted, should result in a reduction of manufacturing and design costs, as well as make the production and maintenance process easier. Moreover, this should also have environmental benefits by reducing fuel consumption.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-220183\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xv,51\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2017:199\", \"keyword\": \"ECU; E/E Architecture; CAN; LIN; Automotive Ethernet; Integrated Architecture; Commercial Trucks; Autonomous Driving; ECU; E/E Arkitektur; CAN; LIN; Automotive Ethernet; Integrerad arkitektur; Kommersiella lastbilar; Autonom k\\u00f6rningxt\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-02-07T12:49:26.149+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-12-17T15:35:36.650+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T22:52:15.544+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-220183\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 66.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1034204\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2016]]}, \"title\": \"Modernizing forms at KTH : Using Digital Signatures\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Engstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Pontus\", \"localId\": \"u1voxtcp\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Today both government agencies and companies struggle to keep up with the pace of the continuous change of technology. With all new technology there are benefits, but new problems might also occur. Implementing new technology for certain tasks may increase both efficiency and security, resulting in a more sustainable work environment. One technology that is increasingly adopted is digital signatures. Instead of using classical handwritten signatures on documents, a digital signature can be more time efficient and have higher security.In order to implement a digital signature technology some security aspects must be addressed and certain properties ensured. In the document signature process, each time an individual verifies a signature attached onto a document a log entry is created. This log contains information about who verified which document, does it have multiple parts that have been signed, does it need multiple signatures in order to be valid, and at what time and date was the document signed. Logs help to ensure the validity of the document and thereby increase the security provided by the digital signatures.At KTH, a student must sign an application form with a regular ink-written signature to start a thesis project. This process can in most cases delay the start up to two weeks. This study aims to implement digital signatures for one specific form, an application form for a thesis project. The hypothesis at the start of the project was that the use of digital signature would decrease the time of waiting significantly. Personnel at KTH using digital signature would facilitate their work efficiency, due to less printing and archiving of papers as well fewer meetings.This study will provide the reader with the necessary fundamental knowledge of cryptography and how digital signatures use this underlying technology. The methodology used in this study was to identify and modify certain software settings, as well collect data from students and personnel at KTH. The collected data was based on time measurements of digital signature processes from students and a faculty member. The results show digital signatures are faster than the current signing process with traditional ink-written signatures. Additionally, the use of digital signatures is expected to reduce the need for printing, transport, and sorting of paper documents. The resulting reduction in use of physical paper should provide environmental benefits.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-193898\", \"number-of-pages\": \"57\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2016:148\", \"keyword\": \"Authentication; cryptography; digital signature; digital certificate; X.509; Adobe Acrobat; LDAP; application form; Autentisering; kryptografi; digitala signaturer; digitala certifikat; X.509; Adobe Acrobat; LDAP; ans\\u00f6kningsblankett\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2016-11-03T08:01:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2016-10-11T14:07:07.146+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-27T05:12:51.791+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-193898\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 57.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:541098\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1995]]}, \"title\": \"Modul f\\u00f6r analog telefoni och fax\", \"language\": \"swe\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Lindell\", \"given\": \"H\\u00e5kan\", \"localId\": \"u1e8doex\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Ismailov\", \"given\": \"Yuri\", \"localId\": \"u1qe4n19\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"abstract\": null, \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-99140\", \"number-of-pages\": null, \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-07-30T14:29:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-07-13T18:30:48.206+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T03:58:35.294+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-99140\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 0.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:541089\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"Modulation Techniques and Medium Access Control Protocols for Wireless Access to ATM\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Gr\\u00fcndl\", \"given\": \"Gabriel Josef\", \"localId\": \"u1xdbh7y\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Bernhard\", \"given\": \"U.\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"ETH Z\\u00fcrich\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Meierhofer\", \"given\": \"J.\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"ETH Z\\u00fcrich\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This report covers modulation techniques and medium access control protocols for wireless ATM.Important aspects of the wave propagation, path loss and time dispersion, are discussed in conjunctionwith the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (FDM) transmission scheme.

Wireless ATM requires a considerable amount of bandwidth.The frequency reuse factor is made small by using building walls as isolation between clusters. Trafficmodels suited to model arrival processes at ATM-multiplexers are developed to use with system perfor-mance analysis in the multiuser environment. Multiplexer buffer size requirements are found to be higherwith bursty sources. ATM switching is based on multiplexing of small data units or cells.

The primary goal of the thesis is to present and analyze cloud solutions that the Swedish armed forces eventually could integrate in to their activities. The first part of the thesis gives an introduction to the cloud technology with the security aspects of a cloud as a large part of the focus. This is followed by information about the Swedish armed forces and their current IT-systems, as well as information on the requirements they have for the implementation of new IT-systems within the organization. Two different cloud services from VMware and Cloudstack have been examined in order to see whether these could be used for a future implementation. The focus of the analysis lies heavily on the security issues and questions, that arise, for each solution, as the security aspect is something that is very important for the Swedish armed forces.The thesis also touches on the economical benefits and economical difficulties associated with cloud service implementation.

The definition of a probe is somewhat vague, but generally you can say that a probe is non-intrusive, and therefore does not affect the network. It is a tool that normally listens to all messages that are transported over a network and records statistics. Almost any kind of network monitor could be called a probe. As the ex-job proceeded it became clear that there were no existing probe tool that worked for measuring IP telephony. Thus I started to look at how an IP based network is normally monitored and what you can do to guarantee QoS (Quality of Service) in an IP based network.\\nIP telephony is based on digitizing, and possibly compressing, audio information into packets of data, which are sent over the IP-based network and finally reconverted from data to audio at the receiving end. Even though the technique for IP telephony is well established, no major telephone company has implemented more than pilot tests. This is because today it is not possible to offer controlled high quality IP telephony. The standards are not yet firmly established and the tools to help operators provide high quality service either do not exist or are still being developed. Thus different vendors' products do not work together. During the time of working on this thesis, a lot has changed, new products are being introduced to the market and standards are being established. It is said that 1999 will be the year for IP telephony, the year when it will be taken seriously and really boom.\\nOne of the motives for IP telephony is reduced cost. The equipment is cheaper and it gives users the chance to bypass the ordinary telephone network, which is sometimes expensive, for example for international phone calls. Compared to normal PSTN the cost is about 40% lower, even when looking only at the comparison with circuit costs and this does not include the cost savings for the much less expensive routers instead of multiplexers and exchanges that are used in the PSTN. Another motive, and probably the most important one is the flexibility of offering new services once you are able to send different types of data over the same network. When all traffic is packetized in IP packets also makes it easier to add new services to the edge of the network. The goal is that the callers will notice no difference between IP telephony and PSTN telephony.\\nPacket networks have a long way to go to deliver high-quality voice services, but this is not the only obstacle on the way before IP telephony will be fully developed. For customers to be interested in the service, some kind of added-value has to be offered. For the telcos (telecommunication companies) IP telephony was for a long time a dilemma; if they would invest a lot of money in IP telephony and launch a high quality product, they would actually be competing with themselves. But if they did not do anything, they would risk being left behind as the new technology evolved. Strategic and tactical moves will be made every step of the way. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been invested in the circuit switched technology and the companies that have made these investments will not be anxious to retire these investments before they have shown profits. It could take anywhere from five years up to more than a decade to effect such a massive changeout. In fact, we don't know if the transition from one network to the other will ever be complete. More billions of dollars will have to be invested in packet switched equipment, and test equipment has to be developed. However, there appear to be many new operators willing to invest in this new infrastructure, so even if the existing telecommunication operators do not make this change others will offer their services.\\nExisting operators have to face the fact that IP telephone minutes generated by carriers in September 1998 totaled 35 million, based on data supplied by service providers. This sum represents a six times increase from 6.3 million minutes generated in December 1997. Expectations vary, but within approximately 5 years one third of all phone calls will be over packet switched networks. Knowing this makes it even more important to be able to offer this service with sufficient quality.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95338\", \"number-of-pages\": \"89\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-21T08:53:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-05-22T18:09:23.346+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:32:27.249+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95338\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 89.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:534359\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"More than downloading : Toward a scale with wireless connectivity\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Ahmid\", \"given\": \"Abdel\", \"localId\": \"u1hgbazx\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Sensors are light-weight, low powered devices that measure some aspect of a physical or virtual environment and transmit this information in some format.

Devices, including common household appliances, will transmit and receive data over a network. The CEO of Ericsson has stated that there will be more than 50 billion connected devices by 2020[1]. These devices could be microwaves, fridges, lights, or temperature sensors.

The sensor will be low cost and simple. It should wirelessly or via USB transmit the current weight that it measures to a receiver (specifically a gateway). This gateway will forward the message over the network to a website or mobile phone for visual presentation of the data.

These devices often include but are not limited to light switches, thermostats, thermometers, window blinds, and climate controls. The potential for these kinds of systems is huge because of the sheer number of devices that could be controlled and managed with minimal and inexpensive extra hardware. Many of the appliances in a normal home could benefit from being connected to a system that allows the owner to manage and control the devices in their home. Thus the number of potential devices is orders of magnitude larger than the number of homes connected to the system. There are several systems on the market that provide systems to monitor and control a home environment, however these systems only support specific in system devices. This uncovers a problem where a homeowner only has the opportunity to use specific products that fit into these systems. By introducing an open platform for the public that are not bound to any system we can allow more devices to be integrated in the home and contribute to further development of smarter homes.\\nThe goal with this project was to provide a scalable open platform with the possibility of asynchronous updating. This has been done by implementing multiple logical parts to both provide a web interface for the user and to allow us to handle communication and storage of data. All these parts are linked together to form a system of servers that handles all background operations. This thesis discusses and presents implementations of all of these servers, how they are implemented, communicate with each other, provide secure connections and how they can scale with increasing usage. In this process we also discuss and present techniques that were used, how to use them and their benefits, to help us reach our goal.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-97937\", \"number-of-pages\": \"41\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:084\", \"keyword\": \"Home monitoring; Smart homes; Ruby on Rails; Asynchronous message passing; Java\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-26T13:59:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-16T14:49:37.625+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:12:17.691+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-97937\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 41.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1314189\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2019]]}, \"title\": \"More tools for Canvas : Realizing a Digital Form with Dynamically Presented Questions and Alternatives\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Sarwar\", \"given\": \"Reshad\", \"localId\": \"u1zo7o3w\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879305\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Manzi\", \"given\": \"Nathan\", \"localId\": \"u1pwjpwa\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879305\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"At KTH, students who want to start their degree project must complete a paper form called \\u201cUT-EXAR: Ans\\u00f6kan om examensarbete/application for degree project\\u201d.

After the form is filled in and signed by multiple parties, a student can initiate his or her degree project. However, due to the excessively time-consuming process of completing the form, an alternative solution was proposed: a survey in the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS) that replace s the UT-EXAR form.Although the survey reduces the time required by students to provide information and find examiners, it is by no means the most efficient solution. The survey suffers from multiple flaws, such as asking students to answer unnecessary questions, and for certain questions, presenting students with more alternatives than necessary. The survey also fails to automatically organize the data collected from the students\\u2019 answers; hence administrators must manually enter the data into a spreadsheet or other record.This thesis proposes an optimized solution to the problem by introducing a dynamic survey. Moreover, this dynamic survey uses the Canvas Representational State Transfer (REST) API to access students\\u2019 program-specific data. Additionally, this survey can use data provided by students when answering the survey questions to dynamically construct questions for each individual student as well as using information from other KTH systems to dynamically construct customized alternatives for each individual student. This solution effectively prevents the survey from presenting students with questions and choices that are irrelevant to their individual case. Furthermore, the proposed solution directly inserts the data collected from the students into a Canvas Gradebook.In order to implement and test the proposed solution, a version of the Canvas LMS was created by virtualizing each Canvas-based microservice inside of a Docker container and allowing the containers to communicate over a network. Furthermore, the survey itself used the Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standard. When testing the solution, it was seen that the survey has not only successfully managed to filter the questions and alternative answers based on the user\\u2019s data, but also showed great potential to be more efficient than a survey with statically-presented data. The survey effectively automates the insertion of the data into the gradebook.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-251021\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xix,120\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2019:93\", \"keyword\": \"Canvas; Learning Management System (LMS); Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI); Docker containers; Microservices Architecture; REST API; Dynamic survey systems; Canvas; L\\u00e4rplattform; L\\u00e4rverktyg Interoperabilitet; Dockercontainenrar; Mikroservices arkitekektur; RESTful API; Dynamisk unders\\u00f6kningssystem\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2019-05-09T12:22:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2019-05-07T18:17:26.146+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T15:50:05.731+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-251021\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 139.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:456654\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2011]]}, \"title\": \"Motion Recognition : Generating real - time feedback based upon movement of a gaming controller\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Aleo Monteagudo\", \"given\": \"Francisco\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Today motion recognition has become popular for human computer interaction in areas, such as health care, computer games, and robotics. Although many research projects have investigated this field, there are still some challenges remaining, especially in real-time environments.In real-time environments, the amount of data needed to compute the user\\u2019s motion and the time required to collect and process this data are crucial parameters in the performance of a motion recognition system. Moreover, the nature of the data (accelerometer, gyroscope, camera, . . . ) determines the design of the motion recognition system. One of the most important challenges is to reduce the delay between sensing and recognizing the motion, while, at the same time, achieving acceptable levels of accuracy.In this thesis we present a solution using Nintendo\\u2019s Wii Remote that solves several problems, such as permitting multiple device interaction and synchronization. In addition, this thesis addresses the performance challenge of realizing motion recognition for such a device. Finally, this thesis introduces a Java architecture which contains a set of interfaces that can be re-used in future projects.One of the most important achievements of this project is enabling interaction among different users and devices in a real-time environment, as, our application deals with multiple devices at the same time, with an acceptable delay. The resulting application provides smooth interaction to the user. As a consequence, our application enables collaborative and competitive activities which in this thesis project were evaluated in a educational process context. In this specific context, the main goal of the researchers with whom I was collaborating was to extend traditional methods of teaching children about some abstract concepts, such as energy.In addition, this thesis shows how to achieve different levels of accuracy and performance, by implementing two different algorithms. The first one is a static algorithm based on heuristics. The second algorithm, called k-Means, is based on data clustering. The heuristics based algorithm provides a result in less than 2 milliseconds, while k-Means takes roughly 4 milliseconds to converge. A comparison of the performance and flexibility of these two algorithms is presented.This project has resulted in a multi-threaded high level architecture based on Java, which enables interaction between Wiimote devices. The Application Programming Interface, can be easily extended for future projects, via several interfaces that provide basic mechanisms, such as an event listener, message delivery, and synchronization module. Moreover, the two different motion recognition algorithms offer different performances and different flexibility features, a crucial parameter closely related with motion recognition accuracy.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-48038\", \"number-of-pages\": \"83\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2011:165\", \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-11-15T13:23:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-11-15T13:22:54.464+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T20:21:23.792+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-48038\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 83.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:507807\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2011]]}, \"title\": \"Moving the museum outside its walls : An Augmented Reality Mobile Experience\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Marshall\", \"given\": \"Tommy\", \"localId\": \"u15pxfja\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This thesis project examines how to design an Android application that uses augmented reality to help users navigate in the City of Stockholm.

Furthermore, the implementation of the Label Distribution component in a Label Edge Router of an MPLS system is described and evaluated.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95461\", \"number-of-pages\": \"34\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-15T08:39:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-05-25T14:42:13.109+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:29:25.581+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95461\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 34.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:512657\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2006]]}, \"title\": \"Multi-Cell Admission Control for WCDMA Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Azzolin de Carvalho Pires\", \"given\": \"Gustavo\", \"localId\": \"u1xj4shi\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Fodor\", \"given\": \"Gabor\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"It has long been recognized that in multi-cell WCDMA networks the admission of a new session into the system can have undesirable impact on the neighboring cells.

In this thesis, we propose a model for multi-cell multi-service WCDMA networks to study the impact of multi-cell admission and rate control algorithms on key performance measures such as the class-wise blocking and outage probabilities, block error rates, and the noise rise violation probabilities. By means of simulation we compare the performance of load based multi-cell algorithms with that of a single cell algorithm. We find that with multi-cell based algorithms the system capacity and performance (in terms of the above mentioned measures) are (in some cases significantly) better in homogeneous load scenarios as well as in the heterogeneous \\u2019hotspot\\u2019 and \\u2019hotaround\\u2019 scenarios.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92203\", \"number-of-pages\": \"66\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2006-11\", \"keyword\": \"WCDMA; Elastic Traffic; Admission Control; Rate Control; Blocking Probability; Outage Probability\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-29T08:22:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-28T15:13:37.883+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:11:18.637+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92203\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 66.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511492\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2008]]}, \"title\": \"Multimedia Messaging Service Components for Web 2.0\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Borgstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Kristofer\", \"localId\": \"u1zav6vk\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Yeung\", \"given\": \"Peter\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The purpose of this master\\u2019s thesis is to simplify the exchange (in both directions) of multimedia content between mobile phones and network attached web servers. The solution proposed in this report specifically concerns displaying Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) messages via a web browser connected to a network-attached web server and graphically authoring MMS messages via a web interface.\\nThis thesis project is important because it brings multimedia content, in the form of MMS messages, from isolation in the telecommunication world closer to wide availability via the Internet. This transition is very important as the Internet is where media is shared with the world today. This approach brings added value to end users who want to share content generated using their phone on a web site. It also provides added value to operators who want to increase the amount of MMS traffic in their networks.\\nThe solution is non-trivial because there are a number of complexities at both ends. This is because the MMS messages that are authored at mobile phones differ between both handset models and manufacturers. Moreover, the format used for MMS (MMS SMIL) is not widely used on the Internet, thus a transformation to an Internet browser supported format must be performed. The thesis examines to what extent this transformation can be completely automatic and how MMS messages can be authored through a web interface.\\nThe results show that MMS messages can be successfully transformed to HTML and embedded directly in web pages, thus providing a seamless experience for viewing MMS messages. Depending on the content of the MMS message in question, the current browser and which media player plug-ins are available, the generated HTML will be displayed differently. The results also show that MMS messages can be composed in real time* through a web interface with good results.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91878\", \"number-of-pages\": \"271\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2008-01\", \"keyword\": \"MMS; Web 2.0; components; MMS SMIL; transformation; MMS composer; MMS viewer; HTML+TIME; HTML\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T15:31:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-21T15:44:22.685+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:16:24.261+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91878\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 271.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:513179\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2005]]}, \"title\": \"Multipath Routing with Load Balancing in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Groleau\", \"given\": \"Romain\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Katabi\", \"given\": \"Dina\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"In recent years, routing research concerning wired networks has focused on minimizing the maximum utilization of the links which is equivalent to reducing the number of bottlenecks while supporting the same traffic demands. This can be achieved using multipath routing with load balancing instead of single path routing using of routing optimizers. However, in the domain of ad hoc networks multipath routing has not been investigated in depth. We would like to develop an analogy between wired and wireless networks, but before that we need to identify the major differences between these two in the case of multipath routing. First, in order to increase the network throughput, the multiple paths have to be independent so they don't share the same bottlenecks. Then, due to radio propagation properties the link capacity is not constant. So using the maximum utilization metric for wireless networks is not suitable. Based on the research done in wired networks, which has shown that using multiple paths with load balancing policies between sourcedestination pairs can minimize the maximum utilization of the links, we investigate if this is applicable to ad hoc networks.This paper proposes a multipath routing algorithm with a load balancing policy. The results obtained from an indoor 802.11g network highlight two major points. The maximum throughput is not achieved with multipath routing, but with single path routing. However, the results on the delivery ratio are encouraging, indeed we observe a real improvement thanks to our multipath routing algorithm.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92299\", \"number-of-pages\": \"65\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-IMIT-LCN.

However, the use of a single escrow agent has some drawbacks. A fraudulent request by an evil employee from the LEA can lead to improper disclosure of a session key. After the escrow agent reveals the key this evil person could fabricate data according to his/her needs and encrypt it again (using the correct session key). In this situation the persons involved in the communication session can be accused of crimes that he or she or they never committed. The problems with a single escrow agent becomes even more critical as a failure of the escrow agent can delay or even make it impossible to reveal the session key, thus the escrow agent might not be able to comply with a lawful court order or comply with their escrow agreement in the case of data being released according to this agreement (for example for disaster recovery).\\nThis thesis project focused on improving the accessibility and reliability of escrow agents, while providing good security. One such method is based on dividing the session key into M chunks and escrowing the chunks with M escrow agents. Using threshold cryptography the key can be regenerated by gathering any N-out-of-M chunks. The value of M and N may differ according to the role of the user. For a highly sophisticated session, the user might define a higher value for M and N for improved, availability, reliability, and security. For a less confidential or less important session (call), the value of M and N might be smaller.

This document describes how to overcome these obstacles by providing the necessary proxy mechanisms, leading to a transparent, seamless, and cost-effective integration of 6LoWPAN nodes into existing IPv6 network infrastructures. In particular, this document details the requirements, specification, and implementation of an embedded device responsible for such integration: a 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery Proxy- Gateway (6LP-GW).\\nMoreover, this report demonstrates that integrating 6LoWPAN nodes into existing IPv6 networks by means of a 6LP-GW as described here is both feasible and convenient in most situations. This convenience can be observed from both the network and the end-user perspectives:\\nFrom the network\\u2019s point of view, the solution proposed here integrates 6LoWPAN <b><b>into\\u00a0 </b></b>an existing IPv6 network.

It should be noted that asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) and cable- TV access networks proved to be unable to meet the requirements for small cell backhaul.This project gives a clear picture of the current broadband access network infrastructure's attributes and highlights the possibility of reducing backhaul costs by using broadband Internet connectivity as a backhaul transport option.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-129070\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiv,84\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:204\", \"keyword\": \"broadband access networks; backhaul; real-time measurements; small cell network; bredbandsteknik; returtrafik; realtidsm\\u00e4tningar; sm\\u00e5celler\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-09-30T08:58:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-09-19T10:48:19.607+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T23:16:08.572+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-129070\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 98.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:512576\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2006]]}, \"title\": \"Network Convergence or Divergence? : A service perspective on the underlying requirements of future handsets\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Possne\", \"given\": \"Jacob\", \"localId\": \"u1vou7mq\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Fontaine\", \"given\": \"Herv\\u00e9\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Sony Ericsson AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Network Convergence or Divergence, what is it, and which are the most likely developments?

A credential-based device discovery method was developed and utilized to make advantage of known credentials to access devices, which allows for more precise discovery compared to some other existing methods. The selected methods were implemented as a component of NCS to provide device discovery functionality.Another focus of this master\\u2019s thesis project was the development of an approach to network topology discovery and its representation.

This increases the eciency of the hardware, hence decreases the cost of cloud computing. However, as the load in the guest operating system increases, at some point the physical resources cannot support all the applications efficiently. Input and output services, especially network applications, must share the same total bandwidth and this sharing can be negatively affected by virtualization overheads. Network packets may undergo additional processing and have to wait until the virtual machine is scheduled by the underlying hypervisor before reaching the final service application, such as a web server.In a virtualized environment it is not the load (due to the processing of the user data) but the network overhead, that is the major problem. Modern network interface cards have enhanced network virtualization by handling IP packets more intelligently through TCP segmentation offload, interrupt coalescence, and other virtualization specific hardware.Jumbo frames have long been proposed for their advantages in traditional environment. They increase network throughput and decrease CPU utilization. \\u00a0Jumbo frames can better exploit Gigabit Ethernet and offer great enhancements to the virtualized environment by utilizing the bandwidth more effectively while lowering processor overhead.

The design is described in detail including a performance analysis of the different modules (microblocks) used. The report also provides an evaluation of the IXP2400 network processor and contrasts it to some other network processors. The detailed performance evaluation is based on a simulator of the IXP2400, which is part of Intel's Software Development Kit (SDK) version 3.0. In addition, I have investigated: the memory bus bandwidth, memory access latencies, and compared Ccompiler against hand-written microcode. These tests were based on using an application for this ET board, which I have implemented.\\nIt proved to be difficult to fit all the required functions into a single chip solution. The result is either one must wait for the next generation of this chip or one has to use a two-chip solution.

Current research suggests that the use of haptic feedback could give an increase in speed and accuracy when doing certain tasks such as outlining organ contours in medical applications or even filling in spreadsheets. This master thesis project has two different goals concerning haptic feedback. The first is to try to improve the forces for the SensAble PHANTOM Omni\\u00ae Haptic Device when used in an application to outline contours in medical images, to give the user better feedback. The PHANTOM Omni is a device able to read in user movement of an arm attached to it in three dimensions, but it is also able to output forces through this arm back to the user, i.e. giving haptic feedback. By improving these forces and thus providing better feedback, we hope that speed and accuracy increases for a user working with the mentioned application.\\nThe second part of the project consists of evaluating if delays in a network between the haptic feedback device and the place where the data sets are located impact the user perceived quality or the outcome of the task. We do this by considering a number of potential architectures for distributing the image processing and generation of haptic feedback. By considering both of these goals we hope to demonstrate both a way to get faster and more accurate results when doing the tasks already mentioned (and other tasks), but also to understand the limitations of haptic performance with regard to distributed processing. We have successfully fulfilled our first goal by introducing a haptic force which seems quite promising. This should mean that the people working with outlining contours in medical images can work more effectively; which is good both economically for hospitals and quality of service-wise for patients.\\nOur results concerning the second goal indicate that a haptic system for outlining contour can work well when using this new haptic force, even on low quality data links (which can be used for example in battlefield medicine or by specialists to conduct long distance operations or examinations) -- if the system architecture distributes the functionality so as to provide low delay haptic feedback locally.\\nWe have tried to compare our results from the second part with a model for the impact of network delay on voice traffic quality developed by Cole and Rosenbluth, but as there is not necessarily a numeric correspondence between the quality values that we used and the ITU MOS quality values for voice we cannot make a numeric comparison between our results and that model. However our experimental data seem to suggest that the decrease in perceived quality was not as fast as one might expect considering simply the ratios of the voice packet rate (typically 50 Hz) and the 1000 Hz rate of the haptic feedback loop. The decrease in quality seems to only be about one half of what the ratio of these rates might suggest (i.e., a factor of 10x faster decrease in quality with increasing delay rather than 20x).\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91494\", \"number-of-pages\": \"91\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2009:106\", \"keyword\": \"Haptics; networked haptics; haptic forces; SensAble PHANTOM Omni Device; medical imaging\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-16T14:04:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-16T11:45:02.888+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:22:36.016+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91494\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 91.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:535617\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"Networking for Smart Meters\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Dandugula\", \"given\": \"Chaitanya\", \"localId\": \"u1kefgxo\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Schoo\", \"given\": \"Peter\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Fraunhofer AISEC, Germany\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"\\\"Smart grid\\\" generally refers to a class of technology bringing electricity delivery systems into the 21st century, using computer-based remote control and automation.

Research in the European Union and the United States are currently underway to modernize the existing and aging transmission grid and to streamline the usage of electricity.\\nA typical electricity grid consists of two major entities - the utility company and the distribution control system (DCS). Electricity is generated at the utility company and the DCS is responsible for the distribution of electricity to individual homes/consumers. A smart meter (SM) is an electronic device that measures the electricity consumed at the consumer's premises and provides added information to the utility company. The data concentration unit (DCU) is a device acting as a communication hub collecting and encoding data from multiple smart meters in a neighborhood and forwarding the data to the utility company. The aim of this project is to design a network for securing the communication between the SM and the DCU in a smart metering network environment.\\nThe meter data communicated from the SM to the DCU is very sensitive and in the hands of an attacker, can reveal significant personal information about an individual. Hence it is of at most importance to protect the meter data transmitted from the SM. On the other hand the control signals transmitted from the DCU to the SM, need protection in order to thwart off unauthorized signals (i.e., an intruder can impersonate the DC and send out control signals to the SMs). Hence the SM and the DCU should be authenticated by each other and authorized and the data and/or control signals exchanged between them should be encrypted.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98210\", \"number-of-pages\": \"56\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:102\", \"keyword\": \"Smart grid; Smart Meter; DTLS; Data Concentration Unit(DCU); Security; BSI; Protection Profile\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-26T13:47:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-20T10:25:58.718+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:10:02.612+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98210\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 56.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:510608\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2009]]}, \"title\": \"Non-binary Authentication : Supplicant\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Zhang\", \"given\": \"Hengchong\", \"localId\": \"u190g8bu\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"There are a number of authentication methods for wireless local area networks.

It is independent of transport (HTTP, WSP, or OBEX) platform, operating system, and application and simplifies synchronisation of personal information between dissimilar SyncML supportive devices.\\nSyncML compliant devices are fully capable of synchronising information with a third party operated Internet based server and a desktop computer. This allows us to access, up-date and maintain information independent of Intranets or geographical position. However, synchronising and storing confidential personal information on an third party operated Internet based server entails weaknesses in our personal information security. Even if transport and storage security are used, how secure is the server where this information is stored since this server has the highest probability of being attacked. Can we really trust that an employee or other person with valid appropriated administrators access to the storage facility with the appropriate knowledge, working together with the third party server operator, won\\u2019t try to access our stored information? To prevent this, the personal information\\u2019s confidentiality must be guaranteed before the information leaves the device.\\nWhen synchronising and exchanging personal information, the information is often marked according to a specific format. The three de-facto standard PIM formats are: (1) vCard (contact information), (2) vCalendar, and (3) iCalendar (calendar and scheduling information). These formats divide the personal information into properties. Each property is assigned to contain a small piece of the personal information entry (e.g. a telephone number, an e-mail address, the time when the calendar event begins, etc.).\\nFurthermore to preserve the interoperability between different devices given by SyncML, authorised recipients must automatically be able to reverse the encryption process and decrypt the encrypted property value. Therefore general cryptographic formats are used (e.g. CMS, PGP and the newly developed XML Encryption). They add information needed by the recipients (e.g. algorithm used, padding method used on the plain text, etc.), encrypt the plaintext into cipher text, and decrypt the cipher text into plain text given the correct key.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93276\", \"number-of-pages\": \"65\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": \"3G; middleware; front-end; operator-hosted; strategy; convergence; XML; hybrid thickness client application; SyncML; Wireless OS; UMTS; GPRS; EPOC; Symbian; value added services\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-13T15:30:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-13T10:48:09.313+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:55:32.845+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93276\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 65.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:510495\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2009]]}, \"title\": \"OBSAI Interoperability in Multi-Vendor WiMAX Base Station Architecture Environment\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Saha\", \"given\": \"Sumanta\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Mikkonen\", \"given\": \"Petri\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Nokia Siemens Networks, Finland\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Wireless networks have become a necessity with the increased mobility in human life. From cellular telephony to the Internet, all types of communication are now provided over wireless networks. However, to offer wireless network coverage over an area requires a potentially expensive infrastructure deployment. Such deployment requires base stations which until now have been completely proprietary to the equipment vendors. Moreover, proprietary equipment is almost always costly and offer less flexibility than standardized modular solutions. This situation results in a high cost for network upgradation and hinders network development. A remedy is available via modularization, hence the Open Base Station Architecture Initiative (OBSAI) is trying to modularize and standardize one of the most expensive elements of the wireless infrastructure, the base station. OBSAI standards aim to modularize the base station architecture and enable true interoperability among the various modules. However, the goal has not yet been achieved due to some features of the standard. This thesis project has studied the standards and pointed out some areas that must be concentrated upon when performing interoperability tests. It also proposes several standards amendments to foster greater interoperability among the modules of a base station. This study focuses on the RP3 interface of the OBSAI specification with the goal of making truly inter-operable baseband and RF modules, thus commoditizing the modules. The result is expected to be lower cost, greater interoperability, faster time-to-market, and more cooperative research.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91500\", \"number-of-pages\": \"95\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2009:62\", \"keyword\": \"OBSAI; RP3; RP3-01; WiMAX; LTE; Base Station\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-16T14:20:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-16T12:23:54.569+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:22:27.297+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91500\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 95.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511673\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2007]]}, \"title\": \"Occupancy Sensor System : For Context-aware Computing\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"H\\u00fcbinette\", \"given\": \"Daniel\", \"localId\": \"u18uuktt\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Smith\", \"given\": \"Mark T.\", \"localId\": \"u18xiviu\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This masters thesis project, \\\"Occupancy Sensor System\\\", was conducted at Kungliga Tekniska H\\u00f6gskolan (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden, during the period 2007-04-24 \\u2013 2007-12-17. The goal of the project was to design an occupancy sensor system that determines if there exists more than one person in a defined region. The output of this system is for use in a context-aware system at the KTH Center for Wireless Systems (Wireless@KTH).\\nThe system is important because there is a need for specific input to context-aware systems concerning occupancy of spaces and because this thesis has focused on a problem that enables new complex and interesting services. Additionally, the specific problem of determining not only occupancy, but if this occupancy is zero, one, many has not been widely examined previously. The significance of zero occupants indicating an empty room has already been recognized as having economic and environmental value in terms of heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, and lighting. However, there has not been an effort to differentiate between a person being alone or if more than one person is present. A context-aware system might be able to use this later information to infer that a meeting is taking place in a meeting room, a class taking place in a classroom or that an individual is alone in a conference room, class room, etc. Thus enabling context-aware services to change their behavior based upon the differences in these situations.\\nAn occupancy sensor system prototype was designed to monitor a boundary by using a thermal detector, gumstix computer, an analog to digital converter prototype board, laptop computer, and a context broker. The testing and evaluation of the system, proved it to be sound. However, there are still further improvements and tests to be made. These improvements include: dynamic configuration of the system, communication between the different system entities, detection algorithms, and code improvements. Tests measuring accuracy of a detection algorithm and determining optimal detector placement need to be performed. The next step is to design applications that use the context information provided from the occupancy sensor system and expand the system to use multiple detectors.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91936\", \"number-of-pages\": \"128\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2007-26\", \"keyword\": \"context-aware; context information; correlation; occupancy; PUA; publish; sensor system; SER; SIP; thermal sensor; ubiquitous computing\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T14:01:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-22T16:14:59.492+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:15:36.426+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91936\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 128.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:508216\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2010]]}, \"title\": \"On-demand Television combined with non-real-time Peer-to-Peer Content Delivery for Television Content Providers\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Vodopivec\", \"given\": \"Dario\", \"localId\": \"u10x08yg\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"With the expansion of the Internet and an increasing fraction of consumers having broadband connections, more and more content is finding its way on-line. Video content is becoming one of the most popular types of media content on the Internet. Traditional media content providers, such as television networks, are placing their content on the Internet in order to gain a broader audience. On-demand websites such as kanal5play.se allow viewers to view the multimedia content they want at the time of their choice. While this gives viewers flexibility in their viewing, it creates resource problems for content providers.\\nStatistics from Kanal5 AB show that, even with individual viewers requesting content when they want, there are still patterns in which multiple viewers watch the same content at the same time. This means there are correlations in the demand for content. With unicast distribution this leads to spikes in requirements for bandwidth to the viewers. These peaks lead to high costs for network and server resources to deliver the requested content, but these resources have low average utilization. This thesis project investigates how a content provider can make use of each viewer\\u2019s own resources to deliver content to other users using peer-to-peer techniques. The thesis evaluates what methods can be used in order to reduce the content provider\\u2019s resource requirements during peak hours by exploiting copies of contents that have already been delivered to viewers who requested this same content earlier.\\nA prototype was made to evaluate the suggested design using Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI), which is built on top of the Transfer Control Protocol (TCP). Experiments show that an initial delay of several seconds is reached on a network with a simulated delay of 100ms, while a minimal initial delay was observed on a network with low delay, i.e. ideal conditions. The throughput results of the prototype show that the suggested solution is adequate for delivering on-demand content supplied by Kanal5 AB. However, the relatively poor startup performance of this solution argues for tuning the application to better work with the TCP protocol or to utilize another transport protocol - especially if the round-trip delay is large as TCP\\u2019s 3-way handshake and flow control algorithm limit the performance of the prototype system.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91100\", \"number-of-pages\": \"65\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"211\", \"keyword\": \"Peer-to-Peer; video on-demand (VoD); on-demand television; Loree\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-08T10:20:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-07T15:51:58.739+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:30:29.534+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91100\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 65.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1178505\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2018]]}, \"title\": \"On-demand virtual laboratory environments for Internetworking e-learning : A first step using docker containers\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Kokkalis\", \"given\": \"Andreas\", \"localId\": \"u168hcmp\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879305\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Learning Management Systems (LMSs) are widely used in higher education to improve the learning, teaching, and administrative tasks for both students and instructors.

This is achieved by adding an (subset) API to the ASI which enables a Content Delivery Proxy to interface with DCXP and leverage context information to enable opportunistic content delivery across Ambient Networks.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92031\", \"number-of-pages\": \"83\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2007-23\", \"keyword\": \"Ambient Networks; Context Dissemination; Context-Awareness; Content Delivery\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-26T10:50:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T17:41:55.228+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:14:01.940+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92031\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 83.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:541075\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2003]]}, \"title\": \"Optimisation of End-to-End TCP Performance in A UMTS Network\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Glifberg\", \"given\": \"Fredrik\", \"localId\": \"u19og8mq\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Helge\", \"given\": \"Johan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Netcom Consultants\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Due to the FEC and ARQ mechanisms in UMTS the wireless part will not introduce loss, but instead introduces latency.

Making sure that this information is easily accessible to its employees is not an easy task. For this task Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems come in handy. However, the ERP systems contain lots of information and may be too complex to handle this information or may be too slow in sharing this information within the organisation. This thesis introduces a new solution for how mobile applications can connect to an ERP system by exploiting database synchronisation, which allows the employees to get the information wherever they are without the need to directly access the ERP system.There are three important questions in this thesis: how the ERP works, how to build a mobile application and, how to build a back end? By combining answers to these questions a whole system is built which is production ready and can copy data between the ERP system and the back end and show the information in a mobile application. The overarching goals were to build a system that could extract data from the ERP system into a proprietary back end and a mobile application that could synchronise with the back end. However, synchronisation between the mobile application and the back end was not implemented due to lack of time. The back end had to be able to scale up to 500 concurrent users and respond within 3 seconds, both of these goals were achieved. The mobile application that was built to display the information to the end user was built with usability in mind, since Netlight wanted a straightforward application that anyone could use. The mobile application was shown to have good usability.The results of this thesis project show that building systems around ERPs, instead of inside them, gives these systems the ability to scale, improved the implementation time, and reduced the company\\u2019s maintenance efforts.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-122986\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xvi,118\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:89\", \"keyword\": \"Enterprise Resource Planning systems; Mobile application development; systems integration; information extraction; Aff\\u00e4rssystem; mobil applikationsutveckling; systemintegration; extrahering av information\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-05-30T15:50:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-05-30T15:37:02.356+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T00:17:20.225+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-122986\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 134.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:621611\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2013]]}, \"title\": \"Optimizing System Level Testing of Evolved Packet Gateway\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Wang\", \"given\": \"Guojun\", \"localId\": \"u1yhko8k\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Nordling\", \"given\": \"Karin\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson AB, Sweden\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The goal of this thesis project is to improve industrial system testing efficiency.

Mobile development is a brand new field and becoming more and more popular. The design process and source code can be used as reference for mobile developers. Based on the Terraplay Test Toolkit, a series of experiments were conducted to test the ability of TTK. These experiments focused on end-to-end latency effects of wireless multiplayer games under different situations such as different packet size, different sending rates, high speed movement, and so on. Although TTK is not a professional test tool, it still reflects the latency variance under different conditions correctly. From these experiments, it was found that for the Terraplay enabled wireless multiplayer games, large average packet size (300 bytes) is NOT a factor with regard to the latency on the Terraplay System; the packet rate can affect the game latency. In a high speed-moving environment, game latency doesn\\u2019t obvious increase. Using HTTP can cause three times higher latency than simply using TCP.

This is exemplified in Software Defined Radios (SDRs) systems. A SDR is a radio system whose components are realized in software rather than in hardware. Among the main advantages of such systems, the most important are flexibility and portability. A SDR system is flexible since its components can be modified and reconfigured without physically modifying the system. Furthermore, a SDR system can be ported to a number of different environments, hence it is not tied to a specific hardware platform. Due to these characteristics, SDRs are being used more and more in both military and public safety sectors.\\nA straightforward consequence of the adaptability to variable environments is the porting of SDRs to embedded processors and handheld devices. These devices usually have significant limitations both in terms of computational performance and power constraints. Although the trend in the development of General Purpose Processors (GPPs) and Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) dictated by the Moore\\u2019s Law has increased the performance of embedded devices, currently they face limitations due to both the power consumption and to the execution time when executing even partial SDR systems.\\nThe objective of this thesis project is the evaluation and the optimization of the performance of software running on the OMAP3530 platform on a BeagleBoard. This thesis focuses specifically on the system performances as a function of the configuration of the communication link between the GPP and the DSP in order to reduce as much as possible the system delay due to the communication among the processor cores in the system. Furthermore, this thesis compares the performance achieved by the system by exploiting the DSP and the NEON vector coprocessor. The results of this study show reduced communication delays, thus facilitating the porting of a SDR like system to an OMAP platform. The experiments were performed on a BeagleBoard Revision C3, a hardware platform based on the Texas Instruments OMAP3530. The OMAP3530 is a processor made up of two cores: the GPP, a 600-MHz ARM Cortex\\u2122-A8 Core and an advanced Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) microprocessor Core, specifically the TMS320C64x+\\u2122 DSP Core. The communication between the two cores is via the DSP/BIOS Link, software designed by Texas Instruments to facilitate the exchanging of data between the two cores. The optimal DSPLink setup was obtained with the MSGQ module. This offered good performance, while reducing the system power consumption and reducing the load on the GPP. Moreover, the DSP-based solution offered better performance than the NEON-based configuration.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-31067\", \"number-of-pages\": \"145\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"21\", \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-03-08T10:07:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-03-08T10:07:16.547+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-25T00:04:33.006+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-31067\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 145.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:542230\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"Performance evaluation of security mechanisms in Cloud Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Kannan\", \"given\": \"Anand\", \"localId\": \"u101tjf9\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Fusenig\", \"given\": \"Volker\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Fraunhofer AISEC, Munich, Germany\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Sharma\", \"given\": \"Ayush\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Fraunhofer AISEC, Munich, Germany\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud service provisioning model which largely focuses on data centre provisioning of computing and storage facilities. The networking aspects of IaaS beyond the data centre are a limiting factor preventing communication services that are sensitive to network characteristics from adopting this approach. Cloud networking is a new technology which integrates network provisioning with the existing cloud service provisioning models thereby completing the cloud computing picture by addressing the networking aspects. In cloud networking, shared network resources are virtualized, and provisioned to customers and end-users on-demand in an elastic fashion. This technology allows various kinds of optimization, e.g., reducing latency and network load. Further, this allows service providers to provision network performance guarantees as a part of their service offering. However, this new approach introduces new security challenges. Many of these security challenges are addressed in the CloNe security architecture.This thesis presents a set of potential techniques for securing different resource in a cloud network environment which are not addressed in the existing CloNe security architecture. The thesis begins with a holistic view of the Cloud networking, as described in the Scalable and Adaptive Internet Solutions (SAIL) project, along with its proposed architecture and security goals. This is followed by an overview of the problems that need to be solved and some of the different methods that can be applied to solve parts of the overall problem, specifically a comprehensive, tightly integrated, and multi-level security architecture, a key management algorithm to support the access control mechanism, and an intrusion detection mechanism. For each method or set of methods, the respective state of the art is presented. Additionally, experiments to understand the performance of these mechanisms are evaluated on a simple cloud network test bed.The proposed key management scheme uses a hierarchical key management approach that provides fast and secure key update when member join and member leave operations are carried out. Experiments show that the proposed key management scheme enhances the security and increases the availability and integrity.A newly proposed genetic algorithm based feature selection technique has been employed for effective feature selection. Fuzzy SVM has been used on the data set for effective classification. Experiments have shown that the proposed genetic based feature selection algorithm reduces the number of features and hence decreases the classification time, while improving detection accuracy of the fuzzy SVM classifier by minimizing the conflicting rules that may confuse the classifier. The main advantages of this intrusion detection system are the reduction in false positives and increased security.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-99464\", \"number-of-pages\": \"85\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:174\", \"keyword\": \"Cloud Networks; Key management; mobile agent; telco cloud; open flow; Intrusion Detection System (IDS); Genetic Algorithm (GA); Fuzzy Support Vector Machine (FSVM); tenfold cross validation\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-07-31T08:53:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-07-30T14:58:01.253+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T03:51:20.765+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-99464\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 85.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1159529\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2017]]}, \"title\": \"Performance Optimization of Virtualized Packet Processing Function for 5G RAN\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"\\u00d6stermark\", \"given\": \"Filip\", \"localId\": \"u1me8myg\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"F\\u00e9nyes\", \"given\": \"G\\u00e1bor\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The advent of the fifth generation mobile networks (5G) presents many new challenges to satisfy the requirements of the upcoming standards. The 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) has several functions which must be highly optimized to keep up with increasing performance requirements. One such function is the Packet Processing Function (PPF) which must process network packets with high throughput and low latency. A major factor in the pursuit of higher throughput and lower latency is adaptability of 5G technology. For this reason, Ericsson has developed a prototype 5G RAN PPF as a Virtualized Network Function (VNF) using an extended version of the Data Plane Development Kit\\u2019s Eventdev framework, which can be run on a general purpose computer. This thesis project optimizes the throughput and latency of a 5G RAN PPF prototype using a set of benchmarking and code profiling tools to find bottlenecks within the packet processing path, and then mitigates the effects of these bottlenecks by changing the configuration of the PPF.Experiments were performed using IxNetwork to generate 2 flows with GTP-u/UDP/IPv4 packets for the PPF to process. IxNetwork was also used to measure throughput and latency of the PPF.The results show that the maximum throughput of the PPF prototype could be increased by 40.52% with an average cut-through latency of 97.59% compared to the default configuration in the evaluated test case, by reassigning the CPU cores, performing the packet processing work in fewer pipeline stages, and patching the RSS function of the packet reception (Rx) driver.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-218090\", \"number-of-pages\": \"vii,69\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT\", \"collection-number\": \"2017:198\", \"keyword\": \"5G; RAN; virtualization; packet processing; NFV; optimization; 5G; RAN; virtualisering; packet processing; NFV; optimering\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-02-09T11:18:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-11-22T18:31:06.840+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T23:17:18.612+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-218090\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 76.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:510986\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2008]]}, \"title\": \"Personalized TV with Recommendations : Integrating Social Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Shahan\", \"given\": \"Michel\", \"localId\": \"u1wbagus\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Lidstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Mattias\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This master\\u2019s thesis concerns how to recommend multimedia content which a user might view \\u2013 with some media player.

The thesis investigates, models, and designs an architecture for a policy management system based on OASIS XACML, that creates an extension to the architecture for management of context information in the AN. In addition to a policy management architecture within an AN, a policy management architecture for composing ANs is also created. To facilitate the transfer of requests and policies, the thesis creates a Policy Management Protocol.

One of the more recent updates, Bluetooth 5.1, provides the ability to compute the location using Angle of Arrival (AoA) or Angle of Departure (AoD). These new features have allowed for better positioning accuracies, where AoA-based positioning has shown sub-meter accuracy. An application area for BLE-based IPS is retail stores where the technology can benefit both the store and its customers.

Additionally, we assume that the application can use the device's e-compass or other means to determine in which direction the user's device is oriented.Based on the position and orientation of the user, the software is assumed to access a database to know what item(s) are near the customer.

This Master of Science thesis investigates how a small start-up company operating in the mobile Internet field could be able to let its customers pay for the companies services.\\nDifferent payment possibilities have been described, compared and evaluated. Amongst the possible solutions are direct Internet payment, credit cards, and micro payment systems. The evaluated solutions are mainly focused on enabling Internet based payments to take place, but the goal is to be able to conduct payments using a standard mobile device. Several technologies could be used to extend the Internet solution to the mobile market. Techniques that can be used and are evaluated in this thesis are: CTI, SMS, WAP, and SAT.\\nWhen offering payment possibilities on the Internet an obvious problem is the security matters. Nevertheless this thesis describes and evaluates the possible solutions available today and a large factor when extending the Internet based payment method to the mobile area are the user confidence and easy to use factors. Furthermore the chosen solution should be possible for a small company to implement. That means that no hardware implementations in the mobile device are acceptable.\\nTwo possible solutions have been implemented and are described in the report. First a real credit card solution for the web case. Second the web solution has been extended to work in a wireless GSM environment using SMS.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93532\", \"number-of-pages\": \"152\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-18T08:34:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-20T10:59:27.909+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:50:33.449+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93532\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 152.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511440\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2008]]}, \"title\": \"Position Determination using multiple wireless interfaces\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Hassell\\u00f6f\", \"given\": \"Daniel\", \"localId\": \"u198k88u\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Bataille\", \"given\": \"F.\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Alcatel Research\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This Master\\u2019s thesis studies different ways of exploiting the signal strength measurements from wireless interfaces for position determination.

However, extracting text from images into a digital format is not an easy problem to solve, and the outputs from the OCR frameworks often include errors. The complexity comes from the many variations in (digital) fonts, handwriting, lighting, etc. To tackle this problem, this thesis investigates two different methods for correcting the errors in OCR output. The used dataset consists of Swedish addresses. The methods are therefore applied to postal automation to investigate the usage of these methods for further automating postal work by automatically reading addresses on parcels using OCR. The main method, the lexical implementation, uses a dataset of Swedish addresses so that any valid address should be in this dataset (hence there is a known and limited vocabulary), and misspelled addresses are corrected to the address in the lexicon with the smallest Levenshtein distance. The second approach is to use the same dataset, but with artificial errors, or artificial noise, added. The addresses with this artificial noise are then used together with their correct spelling to train a machine learning model based on Neural machine translation (Neural Machine Translation (NMT)) to automatically correct errors in OCR read addresses. The results from this study could contribute by defining in what direction future work connected to OCR and postal addresses should go. The results were that the lexical implementation outperformed the NMT model. However, more experiments including real data would be required to draw definitive conclusions as to how the methods would work in real-life applications.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-313940\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,79\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": \"OCR; OCR post-processing; OCR post-correction; NMT; Lexical model; OCR; efterbehandling f\\u00f6r OCR; post-korrigering f\\u00f6r OCR; NMT; lexikal modell\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-15T07:34:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-13T14:45:52.302+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-08-04T12:16:11.498+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-313940\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": \"Stockholm\", \"publisher\": \"KTH Royal Institute of Technology\", \"total_pages\": 92.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:531955\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1997]]}, \"title\": \"Presentation of News Telegrams on the World Wide Web\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"J\\u00f6nson\", \"given\": \"Tobias\", \"localId\": \"u1p9xdee\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}, {\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Hjelm\", \"given\": \"Johan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Bonnier Affarirsinformation\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This thesis describes how to transmit and present news telegrams on the World Wide Web using message queues.

Hardware and software have been used to generate the NMEA messages and to generate a precise 1 pulse per second signal. A graphical user interface (GUI) has been created in order to allow the operators of the emulator to input various parameters to the system used to emulate a GPS receiver.Using this emulator avoids the need for expensive GPS receivers and their connection to an antenna with a good view of the GPS satellites. More importantly, this GPS receiver emulator makes it easier to set up a lab environment for testing different situations with regard to signaling with NMEA data between the emulated GPS receiver and the radio base station equipment that is under test. For example, this allows tests involving incorrect NEMA messages or <b>non</b> once per second pulses.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-118070\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii, 69\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:1\", \"keyword\": \"GPS receiver; NMEA data; 1 pulse per second; Radio Base Station; GPS mottagare; NMEA datan; 1 pulse per skund; Radiobassstationer\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-02-11T12:54:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-02-11T11:25:21.623+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T01:14:58.607+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-118070\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 82.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:541137\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1995]]}, \"title\": \"Provision of reliable multicast services in ATM networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Skoglund\", \"given\": \"Per\", \"localId\": \"u144fhxh\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Lindgren\", \"given\": \"Per\", \"localId\": \"u1lz6cg7\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"abstract\": null, \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-99146\", \"number-of-pages\": null, \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-07-30T14:17:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-07-14T14:40:39.084+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T03:58:23.691+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-99146\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 0.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:515556\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2001]]}, \"title\": \"Push services based on SIP\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Dominique\", \"given\": \"Torkel\", \"localId\": \"u1enov0e\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Bj\\u00f6rkner\", \"given\": \"J\\u00f6rgen\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"HotSIP\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is the most potential protocol for Real Time IP communication, for example IP telephony, today.

Moreover, most of this software and tools are standalone applications, thus they are unconnected and their data can be inconsistent and duplicated. This increase both heterogeneity and the complexity of the development environment.To address this situation, tool integration solutions based on Linked Data are used, as they provide scalable and sustainable integration across different engineering tools. Different systems can access and share data by following the Linked-Data-based Open Service for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) specification. OSLC uses the Tracked Resource Set (TRS) protocol to enable a server to expose a resource set and to enable a client to discover a resource in the resource set.Currently, the TRS protocol uses a client pull for the client to update its data and to synchronize with the server. However, this method is inefficient and time consuming. Moreover, high-frequency pulling may introduce an extra burden on the network and server, while low-frequency pulling increases the system\\u2019s latency (as seen by the client).A push-based low-latency solution for the TRS protocol was implemented using Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) technology. The TRS server uses MQTT to push the update patch (called a ChangeEvent) to the TRS client, then the client updates its content according to this ChangeEvent. As a result, the TRS client synchronizes with the TRS server in real time.Furthermore, a TRS adaptor was developed for Atlassian\\u2019s JIRA, a widely-used project and issue management tool. This JIRA-TRS adaptor provides a TRS provider with the ability to share data via JIRA with other software or tools which utilize the TRS protocol.In addition, a simulator was developed to simulate the operations in JIRA for a period of time (specifically the create, modify, and delete actions regarding issues) and acts as a validator to check if the data in TRS client matches the data in JIRA.An evaluation of the push-based TRS system shows an average synchronization delay of around 30 milliseconds. This is a huge change compared with original TRS system that synchronized every 60 seconds.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-213126\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,48\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2017:138\", \"keyword\": \"Linked Data; Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration; Tracked Resource Set; JIRA; Message Queue Telemetry Transport; Push Technology; L\\u00e4nkade Data; Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration; Tracked Resource Set; JIRA; Message Queue Telemetry Transport; Push-teknologi\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-10-13T09:14:10.973+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-08-29T09:48:27.600+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-27T00:30:01.911+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-213126\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 61.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:531909\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1997]]}, \"title\": \"QoS over Winsock 2 via ATM\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Kasujja\", \"given\": \"David\", \"localId\": \"u17u8fm6\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Abrahamsson\", \"given\": \"Leif\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ellemtel Utveckling AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The aim of the masters thesis was to investigate the properties of Winsock 2, demonstrate an application requesting QoS via Winsock 2 over ATM and analyze it from a user perspective. An application requesting QoS via Winsock 2 over ATM has been demonstrated. Analyzing QoS from a user perspective is a difficult task, especially translating it into technical specifications. A useful method used for analyzing QoS from a user perspective is Round Trip Time (RTT) measurements between two end statations (PC's) communicating over an ATM link. This has been carried out with other programs running parallel to the test program (measuring the RTT) to study the effects that these programs may have on the RTT and eventually the end users perspective of QoS. Other tests performed include studying CPU utilization as a function of the receiving data rate. One application transmitts at different data rates to another application on another end station (PC) over the ATM link and the CPU utilization on the receiving end station is studied.\\nTo run real time applications (voice, video, etc) and maintain good quality with minimal delay over an ATM link, these programs should be given high priority by the Operating System or other mechanism to minimize delay. Disk I/O should also be kept minimal, as this could affect the delay or overall quality of the delay sensitive programs. A draw back that many application programmers will experience whilst writing programs for ATM, is the number of QoS parameters that have to be set.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-96662\", \"number-of-pages\": null, \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-13T11:06:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-08T12:07:07.631+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:17:08.964+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-96662\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 0.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:541080\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2001]]}, \"title\": \"QoS Simulation of IP based GSM and EDGE Radio Access Network\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Kristiansen\", \"given\": \"Joakim\", \"localId\": \"u16w4lbs\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Due to increased popularity and acceptance of mobile communication the data services (i.e., General Packet Radio Services) has become standardized and is now implemented and ready for usage. General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) enables a mobile user to use up to eight time slots in a channel to increase their bitrate during data transmission. Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) will increase the bitrate during data transmission even more due to a newer modulation techniques which can be used in a given time slot.Both voice calls and data traffic generates signalling to setup and release the sessions for voice calls and data traffic. In an IP based GSM and EDGE Radio Access Network (IP based GERAN) there will be problems to ensure low delay of packets between nodes for voice traffic and signalling traffic. There are different ways to cope with this problem mainly using different scheduling algorithms, like Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) and Class Based Queuing (CBQ).IP based GERAN using Class Based Queuing was studied using simulation. The first case study different bandwidths for voice traffic and control signalling were examined. In the second case study the voice traffic has higher priority than signalling traffic and in the third case study the voice traffic and control signalling have the same priority. The result is that in the first case the control signalling is affected, but not delayed due to the amount of voice traffic. In the second case the control signalling is affected when voice traffic used more than 60% of the bandwidth and in the third case the control signalling is not affected at all.If some of the new protocols (e.g., SIP) are used to carry a voice over IP session from a mobile terminal to a terminal in the Internet it would be desirable to be able to ensure Quality of Service end to end.

In other words, there should not be any decrease in the quality of service experienced by the end users due to the mobility or wireless factor.\\nWhen developing quality of service support mechanisms that use characteristics specific to the Internet Protocol, considerations have to be made to make certain that the solutions and implementations developed will be deployable with the next generation Internet Protocol, IPv6. Since the ever decreasing address space in IPv4 is becoming more and more of a problem, at some point migration to IPv6 has to be made. Therefore, this thesis will base its developments on the use of IPv6.\\nThe thesis concerns the problem of providing statistical QoS guarantees for multimedia applications running over a wireless LAN such as WaveLAN. Using the DiffServ model and support of IPv6, we develop mechanisms for managing QoS and mobility. With the use of pre-connection schemes and a domain routing approach, Mobile Node mobility and Handoffs are handled in such a way to diminish latencies that occur when in-LAN and cross-LAN handoffs are made. To handle QoS guarantees, a bandwidth broker placed in the Access Points manages bandwidth allocations for different cells and configures the traffic parameters of each mobile so that the usage of the wireless MAC layer is controlled.

This was developed together with the app developer company The Mobile Life, who also provided access to app data for 16 of their published iOS and Android apps. The implementation utilizes automated download and import from online data sources, and provides a web based graphical user interface to display this data using tables and charts.Using mathematical software, a number of statistical methods have been applied to the collected dataset. Analysis findings include different categories (clusters) of apps, the existence of correlations between metrics such as an app\\u2019s market ranking and the number of downloads, a long-tailed distribution of keywords used in app reviews, regression analysis models for the distribution of downloads, and an experimental application of Pareto\\u2019s 80-20 rule which was found relevant to the gathered dataset.Recommendations to the app company include embedding session tracking libraries such as Google Analytics into future apps.

The users can dial-up over public switched telephone network connection when they want to access the Internet or a Corporate LAN. The construction of new telephony networks based on IP-technology gives the possibility to integrate new services in these networks. Such a new service could be a remote access service integrated in the Media Gateways used for IP-telephony. The main goal with this Master Thesis project is to evaluate possible architectures for integrating distributed remote access service in Voice over IP networks.\\nThe conclusion of my evaluation is that the best way to integrate the dial-up network access service in VoIP networks is the L2TP solution. Traditionally a PPP session is established between the dial-up user and the network access server over a PSTN/ISDN connection. In the L2TP solution a Media Gateway terminates the physical and data link layer and use the L2TP protocol to tunnel the PPP session to a network access server over the IP network. The PPP session is terminated on the network access server.\\nAnother interesting solution is the PPP solution where the Media Gateway and a router handle all the dial-up network access features that a traditional network access server normally provides. The PPP session is terminated directly on the Media Gateway and the traffic is forwarded out on the external network by the router. In this solution the network access server is no longer needed.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-94950\", \"number-of-pages\": \"61\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-20T16:15:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-05-11T16:37:57.568+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:36:59.749+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-94950\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 61.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:528442\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1998]]}, \"title\": \"Real-time Multimedia Transmission over a Dynamic Synchronous Transfer Mode Network\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Larsson\", \"given\": \"Jonas\", \"localId\": \"u1vqbc68\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Torstendahl\", \"given\": \"Seved\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Netinsight\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"In this thesis we design and implement a system to transport multimedia traffic (e.g., video and audio) over a Dynamic synchronous Transfer Mode (DTM) network.

Much research is thus focused on how to increase the transmission rate in cellular networks. A general consequence of increasing transmission rate in a radio link is a corresponding increase in transmit power, resulting in increased interference and reduced network capacity. The straightforward way to reduce this effect is to shorten the link distance, which in the cellular case means shrinking the cells. This, however, means increased control traffic for handoffs and location registration, as well as increased infrastructure costs.An alternative approach, which has received increased attention lately, is the introduction of wireless multihop access networks to relay traffic between the wired infrastructure and the users. Such an access network must clearly accommodate all types of services expected to operate in next generation systems, including real-time services. However, wireless multihop networks have traditionally had problems meeting the delay requirements posed by such services.In this thesis, we will study the delay performance through analysis and simulation of such a network, based on the Virtual Cellular Network proposal [1], in which geographically fixed wireless relays are deployed to act as both network nodes and user relays.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92264\", \"number-of-pages\": \"57\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-IMIT-LCN.

This thesis is conducted for the Institute for Microelectronics and Information Technology (IMIT) at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm (Sweden) and for the Department of Telecommunications at Politecnico di Torino in Turin (Italy).\\nThis thesis addresses an area with significant potential for offering services to mobile users. In such a scenario users should have minimal interaction with applications which, by taking into account available context information, should be able to make decisions, such as setting up delivery paths between peers without requiring a third party for the negotiation.\\nIn wireless reconfigurable networks, the mobile users are on the move and must deal with dynamic changes of network resources. In such a network, mobile users should be able to contact other peers or resources by using the current route. Thus although manual configuration of the network is a possible solution, it is not easily used because of the dynamic properties of the system which would demand too much user interaction. However, existing discovery protocols fall short of accomodating the complexity of reconfigurable and heterogeneous networks.\\nThe primary objective of this thesis work was to investigate a new approach at the application level for signaling by taking advantage of SIP\\u2019s features. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is used to provide naming and localization of the user, and to provide functionality to invite users to establish sessions and to agree on communication parameters. The Specific Event Notification of the SIP protocol provides a framework for the notification of specific events and I believed that it could be instantiated as solution to the problem for reconfigurable application networks.\\nThis thesis proposes a method for providing localization information to SIP User Agents in order to establish sessions for service discovery. Furthermore, this method should consider context meta-data to design strategies effective in heterogeneous networks. A viable solution must support (re)location of users at the application layer when they roam between different wireless networks, such as GPRS and WLAN. An analysis of the implications of the proposed model is presented; in this analysis emphasis has been placed on how this model interacts with existing services.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93115\", \"number-of-pages\": \"116\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": \"wireless reconfigurable networks; Session Initiation Protocol (SIP); context meta-data; service discovery\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-13T14:50:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-11T17:09:11.759+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:58:05.735+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93115\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 116.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:510979\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2008]]}, \"title\": \"Remote Desktop : Integrating multiple devices\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Sabat\\u00e9 Mogica\", \"given\": \"David\", \"localId\": \"u1op7l5a\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": null, \"abstract\": \"Electronic devices have acquired an increasingly important role in our society and are integrated in our lives making both the users and their devices more accessible. Currently in the western world most families have at least one computer. This computer is generally equipped with multimedia accessories and an Internet connection. Portable devices, such as mobile phones and PDAs, are part of this technological and social environment. One might think about using a hands free Bluetooth headset together with a mobile phone, to obtain better sound quality, using a keyboard such as the Handykey Corp. Twiddler in order to dial/type quicker or send SMS messages in an easier way, watching a video on a large computer screen that had previously been downloaded to your mobile phone, etcetera. However, there is a problem when it comes to the interconnectivity between all these devices.\\nToday users face many difficulties when attempting to use what should be the aggregated possibilities of their devices, rather than simply the functionality of each device. The hypothesis of this project is that the user's difficulties could be overcome if their devices could be internetworked.\\nFor example, even though mobile phones and PDAs often have a USB interface, unlike typical desktop or laptop computers these devices have been designed to only be USB slaves -- hence other USB devices cannot be directly attached to them. There are some signs of this changing with the introduction of USB On-The-Go - but we believe that this is a short-sighted evolutionary step.\\nThe obvious solution is to internetwork these devices. For example, by attaching these various USB devices to a computer that is a USB bus master (host) - we can enable the user to use their USB Twiddler with a USB phone. In this way, a user could remotely access the functions of the set of all of their portable devices - without worrying about how to directly interconnect them in pairs. This could enable new functionality, such as the user being able to answer an incoming call to their cellular phone with the keypad of the Twiddler, while using the audio input and output functions of their Bluetooth headset.\\nWe begin by examining a number of means to establish and use remote connections to access systems remotely. We have focused on the most popular desktop sharing systems, specifically those that use remote desktop protocols. Initially we require manual configuration or use of a discovery protocol to identify the different devices. Later we will examine additional protocols, along with some potentially automatic configuration mechanisms.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91667\", \"number-of-pages\": \"36\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2008-15\", \"keyword\": \"vnc; remote desktop; X Windowing system\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T15:46:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-19T15:52:46.062+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:19:57.743+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91667\", \"note\": \"1F1421 Project report Oral presentation given 2008-07-30 14:00 http://www.ict.kth.se/info/GRU/Events/Old-Seminars/2008/20080730-14.00-CCS-Exjobb-presentation.html\", \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": \"KTH Royal Institute of Technology\", \"total_pages\": 36.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:514611\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2004]]}, \"title\": \"Remote Residential Control System\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Lang\", \"given\": \"Ming-Shuang\", \"localId\": \"u1qjqeer\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Walling\", \"given\": \"Erik\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"SiceIT AB\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Thelin\", \"given\": \"Bj\\u00f6rn\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ecton AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"A remote residential control system enables home users to remotely manage devices at their homes.

A whistleblowing service within an entity should provide secure communication for the organization and its employees. One way to make whistleblowing more accessible is by providing a service for verbal reporting, for example by recording and sending voice messages. However, ensuring that the speaker is secure and can feel anonymous can be difficult since speech varies between individuals - different accents, pitch, or the speed of the voice are examples of factors that a speaker can be identified by.Common ways of voice anonymization, that you hear on the news for example, can often be backtracked or in other ways be deanonymized such that the speaker\\u2019s identity is revealed, especially for people who know the speaker. Today we have many developing technologies, such as machine learning, which could be used to greatly improve anonymity or deanonymization. However, greater anonymity is often costly with regard to the intelligibility and sometimes the naturalness of the voice content. Therefore, we studied and evaluated a number of anonymization methods with respect to anonymity, intelligibility, and overall user-friendliness. The aim of this was to map what anonymization methods are suitable for whistleblowing and implement proof of concepts of such an anonymizer. The results show differences between anonymization methods and that some perform better than others, but in different ways. Different methods should be selected depending on the perceived threat.

It involves PacketLogic traffic data collecting, MySQL database storing, and traffic and user behavior analysis by using Python scripts.\\n\\u00a0\\nOur approach provides new insights on residential network traffic properties and Internet user habits of households, covering topics of aggregated traffic pattern, household traffic modeling, traffic and user penetration for applications, grouping analysis by cluster and subscriber, and concurrent application analysis. The analysis solutions we provide are based on open source tools without proprietary, giving the most flexibility for codes modification and distribution.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-27001\", \"number-of-pages\": \"62\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2010-12-02T13:42:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2010-12-02T13:40:43.282+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-25T01:14:00.370+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-27001\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 62.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:634366\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2013]]}, \"title\": \"Resource monitoring in a Network Embedded Cloud : An extension to OSPF-TE\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Roozbeh\", \"given\": \"Amir\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0003-4088-7884\", \"localId\": \"u15ez6rj\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Sefidcon\", \"given\": \"Azimeh\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The notions of \\\"network embedded cloud\\\", also known as a \\\"network enabled cloud\\\" or a \\\"carrier cloud\\\", is an emerging technology trend aiming to integrate network services while exploiting the on-demand nature of the cloud paradigm. A network embedded cloud is a distributed cloud environment where data centers are distributed at the edge of the operator's network. Distributing data centers or computing resources across the network introduces topological and geographical locality dependency.In the case of a network enabled cloud, in addition to the information regarding available processing, memory, and storage capacity, resource management requires information regarding the network's topology and available bandwidth on the links connecting the different nodes of the distributed cloud. This thesis project designed, implemented, and evaluated the use of open shortest path first with traffic engineering (OSPF-TE) for propagating the resource status in a network enabled cloud. The information carried over OSPF-TE are used for network-aware scheduling of virtual machines. In particular, OSPF-TE was extended to convey virtualization and processing related information to all the nodes in the network enabled cloud.Modeling, emulation, and analysis shows the proposed solution can provide the required data to a cloud management system by sending a data center's resources information in the form of new opaque link-state advertisement with a minimum interval of 5 seconds. In this case, each embedded data centers injects a maximum 38.4 bytes per second of additional traffic in to the network.&lt;p&gt;\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-124367\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xxxix,338\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:85\", \"keyword\": \"network enabled cloud; network embedded cloud; carrier cloud; Cloud LSA; data center model; opaque LSA; link-state update policy; OSPF-TE; resource monitoring; network-aware; cloud management system; extended TED; n\\u00e4tverk aktiverat moln; n\\u00e4tverk inb\\u00e4ddade moln; b\\u00e4rare moln; moln LSA; datacenter modell; ogenomskinlig LSA; l\\u00e4nk-stat uppdatering policy; OSPF-TE; resurs \\u00f6vervakning; cloud f\\u00f6rvaltning systemet; f\\u00f6rl\\u00e4ngd TED\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-07-01T08:57:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-06-30T12:46:24.500+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T23:55:51.148+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-124367\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 377.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:631732\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2013]]}, \"title\": \"Route aggregation in Software-defined Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Shahzad\", \"given\": \"Syed Amir\", \"localId\": \"u1p20ukx\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Sk\\u00f6ldstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Pontus\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Acreo AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Software-defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging trend in communication networks that facilitates decoupling the control and data plane of multilayer switches. A logically centralized controller hosted on a server configures the forwarding tables (flow tables) of switches in order to route the various data flows.\\u00a0 To implement SDN, OpenFlow technology has been adopted by packet switching vendors as it provides increased flexibility for the control and management of a packet switched domain. OpenFlow technology provides flow based switching that is controlled by a network management control application running in an OpenFlow controller. In this thesis work we investigate how an OpenFlow Controller communicates with a legacy network via the OSPF routing protocol, how the size of the OpenFlow network effects the resources (memory and CPU) of a legacy router to whom the controller communicates. Also we examine bandwidth utilization of the link (between the OpenFlow network and legacy router). The main goal of this thesis is to find methods to reduce the consumption of resources of a legacy router. This study shows that the size of OpenFlow network directly affects the usage of the link\\u2019s bandwidth, and the memory and CPU usage of a legacy router. Aggregated information from the OpenFlow controller which is sent towards the legacy router can reduce the utilization of these resources. Finally we proposed several algorithms and design models that can be implemented for route aggregation in Software-defined Networks.\\u00a0 Implementation of the solutions suggested in this thesis will allow automatic route aggregation in SDN.

LDAP is a protocol used by clients to retrieve information from a directory server.\\nThis report describes how an LDAP directory may be used to share user data in a computer network. First the concept of distributed directory information is presented. Then LDAP is carefully described and compared with X.500, a larger and more complex service. After that we look at the possibility to implement LDAP when developing own systems. Deployment issues and available LDAP products are discussed. A project demo system is presented and described. The demo system shows how different systems can share user information stored in an LDAP directory and how operating systems may be migrated with the directory.

These are only some of the factors that are causing growing concern for security in mobile communication.\\nToday there are several products for authentication and secure communication over the Internet. However, most algorithms and techniques were designed and optimised for stationary clients such as PCs, which have a high bandwidth network connection and endless power. Handheld devices with less memory, a less powerful CPU, and only narrow bandwidth network connection have more limited possibilities for security than stationary PCs.\\nThe purpose of this M.Sc Thesis was to examine the suitability of the existing techniques for authentication and secure communication for handheld devices in the mobile Internet.\\nEvaluation of different algorithms shows that the Rijndael algorithm and Elliptic Curves techniques are the most suitable ones for mobile devices. The security protocol I recommend today is SSL.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93284\", \"number-of-pages\": \"69\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-18T14:05:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-13T12:43:27.964+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:55:18.407+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93284\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 69.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:510489\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2009]]}, \"title\": \"Secure Context-Aware Mobile SIP User Agent\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Merha\", \"given\": \"Bemnet Tesfaye\", \"localId\": \"u10ug2m3\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Br\\u00e6k\", \"given\": \"Rolv\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"NTNU\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Hasnes\", \"given\": \"Geir\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"NTNU\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Context awareness is an important aspect of pervasive and ubiquitous computing. By utilizing contextual information gathered from the environment, applications can adapt to the user\\u2019s specific situation. In this thesis, user context is used to automatically discover multimedia devices and services that can be used by a mobile Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) user agent. The location of the user is captured using various sensing technologies to allow users of our SIP user agent to interact with network attached projectors, speakers, and cameras in a home or office environment.\\nIn order to determine the location of the user, we have developed and evaluated a context aggregation framework that gathers and analyzes contextual information from various sources such as passive infrared sensors, infrared beacons, light intensity, and temperature sensors. Once the location of the user is determined, the Service Location Protocol (SLP) is used to search for services. For this purpose, we have implemented a mobile SLP user agent and integrated it with an existing SIP user agent. The resulting mobile SIP user agent is able to dynamically utilize multimedia devices around it without requiring the user to do any manual configuration.\\nThis thesis also addressed the challenge of building trust relationship between the user agent and the multimedia services. We propose a mechanism which enables the user agent authenticate service advertisements before starting to redirect media streams. The measurements we have performed indicate that the proposed context aggregation framework provides more accurate location determination when additional sensors are incorporated. Furthermore, the performance measurements indicate that the delay incurred by introducing context awareness to the SIP user agent is acceptable for a small deployment such as home and office environment. In order to realize large scale deployments, future investigations are recommended to further improve the performance of the framework.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91499\", \"number-of-pages\": \"128\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2009:63\", \"keyword\": \"SIP; context-awareness; service discovery; trust establishment; SIP; kontext medvetenhet; tj\\u00e4nst uppt\\u00e4ckt; f\\u00f6rtroende etablering\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-16T14:00:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-16T12:14:33.900+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:22:29.159+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91499\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 128.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:513159\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2005]]}, \"title\": \"Secure data and voice over wireless networks in disaster and emergency response\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Vu Hoang\", \"given\": \"Tung\", \"localId\": \"u1mwxax3\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Gannon\", \"given\": \"Sarah\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Response\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Communication is often limited in a disaster area and other emergency situations where no infrastructure exists or existing infrastructure has been destroyed.

Today supervisory control and data acquisition systems utilizing network connected programmable logic controllers are widely used in many industries and critical infrastructures. These network-attached devices have been under increasing attack for some time by malicious attackers (including in some cases possibly government supported efforts).This thesis evaluates currently available solutions to mitigate these attacks.

Moreover, the experiments show that the distribution time depends primarily on network latency rather than the time required to split the cryptographic key in chunks; hence the approach is usable in practice.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-240425\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xxi,74\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2018:764\", \"keyword\": \"LTE; VoLTE; LBO; Lawful Intercept; Multiple Escrow Agents; Shamir\\u2019s Secret Sharing; LTE; VoLTE; LBO; laglig avlyssning; flera \\\"Escrow Agents\\\"; Shamirs krypteringsmetod\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-12-21T07:08:30.029+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-12-19T09:00:27.515+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T18:00:43.823+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-240425\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 95.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:643035\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2013]]}, \"title\": \"Securing Safebook : Secure Data Access Control and Key Management for Safebook\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Ali\", \"given\": \"Waqas Liaqat\", \"localId\": \"u1jo2ekk\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"\\u00d6nen\", \"given\": \"Melek \\u00d6nen\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Institut Eur\\u00e9com\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Cutillo\", \"given\": \"Leucio Antonio\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Institut Eur\\u00e9com\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Online social networks have become a fast and efficient way of sharing information and experiences. Over the past few years the trend of using social networks has drastically increased with an enormous amount of users\\u2019 private contents injected into the providers\\u2019 data centers. This has raised concerns about how the users\\u2019 contents are protected and how the privacy of users is preserved by the service providers. Moreover, current social networks have been subject to much criticism over their privacy settings and access control mechanism. The providers own the users\\u2019 contents and these contents are subject to potential misuse. Many socially engineered attacks have exposed user contents due to the lack of sufficient privacy and access control. These security and privacy threats are addressed by Project Safebook, a distributed peer-to-peer online social networking solution leveraging real life trust. By design Safebook decentralizes data storage and thus the control over user content is no longer in the service provider\\u2019s hands. Moreover, Safebook uses an anonymous routing technique to ensure communication privacy between different users.This thesis project addresses privacy aware data management for Safebook users and a data access control solution to preserve users\\u2019 data privacy and visibility utilizing a peer to peer paradigm. The solution focuses on three sub-problems: (1) preserving the user\\u2019s ownership of user data, (2) providing an access control scheme which supports fine grained access rights, and (3) secure key management. In our proposed system, the user profile is defined over a collection of small data artifacts. An artifact is the smallest logical entity of a profile. An artifact could be a user\\u2019s status tweak, text comment, photo album metadata, or multimedia contents. These artifacts are then logically arranged to form a hierarchical tree, call the User Profile Hierarchy. The root of the profile hierarchy is the only entry point exposed by Safebook from where the complete user profile can be traversed. The visibility of portions of the user profile can be defined by exposing a subset of profile hierarchy. This requires limiting access to child artifacts, by encrypting the connectivity information with specific access keys. Each artifact is associated with a dynamic access chain, which is an encrypted string and contains the information regarding the child nodes. A dynamic access chain is generated using a stream cipher, where each child\\u2019s unique identifier is encrypted with its specific access key and concatenated to form the dynamic access chain. The decryption process will reveal only those child artifacts whose access keys are shared. The access keys are managed in a hierarchical manner over the profile hierarchy. Child artifacts inherit the parent\\u2019s access key or their access key can be overridden with a new key. In this way, fine grained access rights can be achieved over a user\\u2019s artifacts. Remote users can detect changes in a specific branch of a profile hierarchy and fetch new artifacts through our proposed profile hierarchy update service. On top of the proposed access control scheme, any social networking abstraction (such as groups, circles, badges, etc.) can be easily implemented.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-126987\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xv,101\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:199\", \"keyword\": \"User Privacy; Access Control; Distributed Social Networks; Key Management; Anv\\u00e4ndarnas Privatliv; Atkomstkontroll; Distribuerade Sociala N\\u00e4tverk; Nyckelhantering\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-09-23T15:57:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-08-25T16:48:14.372+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T23:35:20.668+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-126987\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 116.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1147703\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2017]]}, \"title\": \"Security Analysis of Ethernet in Cars\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Talic\", \"given\": \"Ammar\", \"localId\": \"u1vdfb7q\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Hocke\", \"given\": \"Roland\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Vector Informatik GmbH Stuttgart, Germany\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"With the development of advanced driving assistance systems, the amount of data that needs to be transmitted within a car has increased tremendously.

In that time several vulnerabilities of the networking protocol stack implementations and even the protocols themselves have been discovered. The knowledge from exploiting computer networks can be applied to the automotive domain. Additionally, vehicle manufacturers tend to implement their own stacks, due to copyleft reasons; hence the chances of implementation faults increases as opposed to using well-tested open source solutions.

It starts with an introduction to computer and automotive networking and protocols. After a solid foundation is laid, it investigates what makes up automotive Ethernet, its application in the field, and the automotive specific components relying on it. After looking at related work, a data network security audit and analysis as defined by the open-source security testing methodology is performed. The system is graded with risk assessment values. Weak points are identified and improvements suggested. The impact of the proposed improvements is shown by reevaluating the system and recalculating the risk assessment values.These efforts further the ultimate goal of achieving increased safety of all traffic participants.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-215329\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xvi,81\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2017:180\", \"keyword\": \"Automotive security; penetration testing; automotive Ethernet; TCP/IP; DoIP; BroadR-Reach; OSSTMM; flash bootloader; Ethernet f\\u00f6r fordon; TCP/IP; Ethernet s\\u00e4kerhet; DoIP; BroadR-Reach; OSSTMM; flash bootloader\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-10-13T09:20:10.437+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-10-07T14:53:02.315+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T23:58:09.625+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-215329\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 97.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:456509\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2011]]}, \"title\": \"Security as a Service in Cloud for Smartphones\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Subramanian\", \"given\": \"Lakshmi\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": null, \"abstract\": \"Smartphone usage has been continuously growing in recent times.

In this thesis, we will look at the next step in the virtualization revolution, the virtualized network. Software-defined networking (SDN) is a relatively new concept that is moving the field towards a more software-based solution to networking. Today when a packet is forwarded through a network of routers, decisions are made at <i>each </i>router as to which router is the next hop destination for the packet. With SDN these decisions are made by a centralized SDN controller that decides upon the best path and instructs the devices along this path as to what action each should perform. Taking SDN to its extreme minimizes the physical network components and increases the number of virtualized components. The reasons behind this trend are several, although the most prominent are simplified processing and network administration, a greater degree of automation, increased flexibility, and shorter provisioning times. This in turn leads to a reduction in operating expenditures and capital expenditures for data center owners, which both drive the further development of this technology.Virtualization has been gaining ground in the last decade. However, the initial introduction of virtualization began in the 1970s with server virtualization offering the ability to create several virtual server instances on one physical server. Today we already have taken small steps towards a virtualized network by virtualization of network equipment such as switches, routers, and firewalls. Common to virtualization is that it is in early stages all of the technologies have encountered trust issues and general concerns related to whether software-based solutions are as rugged and reliable as hardwarebased solutions. SDN has also encountered these issues, and discussion of these issues continues among both believers and skeptics. Concerns about trust remain a problem for the growing number of cloud-based services where multitenant deployments may lead to loss of personal integrity and other security risks. As a relatively new technology, SDN is still immature and has a number of vulnerabilities. As with most software-based solutions, the potential for security risks increases. This thesis investigates how denial-of-service (DoS) attacks affect an SDN environment and a singlethreaded controller, described by text and via simulations.The results of our investigations concerning trust in a multi-tenancy environment in SDN suggest that standardization and clear service level agreements are necessary to consolidate customers\\u2019 confidence. Attracting small groups of customers to participate in user cases in the initial stages of implementation can generate valuable support for a broader implementation of SDN in the underlying infrastructure. With regard to denial-of-service attacks, our conclusion is that hackers can by target the centralized SDN controller, thus negatively affect most of the network infrastructure (because the entire infrastructure directly depends upon a functioning SDN controller). SDN introduces new vulnerabilities, which is natural as SDN is a relatively new technology. Therefore, SDN needs to be thoroughly tested and examined before making a widespread deployment.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-177394\", \"number-of-pages\": \"49\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2014:161\", \"keyword\": \"Software Defined Networks (SDN); network security; denial of service; distributed denial of service; multi-tenancy; mjukvarudefinierat n\\u00e4tverk; n\\u00e4tverkss\\u00e4kerhet; \\u00f6verbelastningsattack; distribuerad \\u00f6verbelastningsattack; multitenans\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-11-19T16:19:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-11-19T14:33:16.964+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T11:38:07.668+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-177394\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 49.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1613886\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2021]]}, \"title\": \"Security Evaluation of Damper System\\u2019s Communication and Update Process : Threat modeling using vehicleLang and securiCAD\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Ekelund\", \"given\": \"Joar\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879223\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r elektroteknik och datavetenskap (EECS)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Lagerstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Robert\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0003-3089-3885\", \"localId\": \"u139ne4r\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879231\", \"name\": \"KTH, N\\u00e4tverk och systemteknik\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"As the automotive industry becomes increasingly reliant on digital systems it is of utmost importance that these systems are secure.

A systematic literature study was performed to identify known vulnerabilities of similar systems as well as potential cybersecurity solutions. A threat model was constructed using vehicleLang, the Meta Attack Language, and securiCAD. The model was created utilizing preexisting assets from vehicleLang and a newly implemented Bluetooth asset. The result from the systematic literature study was used to validate preexisting attack steps and also to create the Bluetooth asset. To validate the model, experts in the field of automotive security and/or threat modeling were asked to assess the model. Using Cochran\\u2019s Equation, a target of eight expert evaluations were decided. Unfortunately, only seven evaluations were obtained, equivalent to an increase in the error margin from 25% to 26.6%. However, of the seven expert evaluations obtained none indicated the existence of critical flaws within the model. The model was therefore considered a good reflection of the damper system and its security aspects. Critical defenses included the utilization of cryptography, mutual authentication, and on-the-fly decryption. These defenses were shown to prevent unauthorized modifications of firmware and protect \\u00d6hlins intellectual property in form of source code.

The most important feature is that the computing resources are available whenever they are needed. Additionally, users pay only for the resource they actually use.

The goal of this thesis is to provide security in a system, being developed in another Master\\u2019s thesis project, to implement the ifoodbag web application in a cloud. To achieve this goal, we began by identifying the risks, threats, and vulnerabilities in the system model proposed by these other students for their implementation. A study was made of several different security mechanisms that might reduce or eliminate risks and secure the most vulnerable points in the proposed system\\u2019s design. Tests of these alternatives were conducted to select a set of mechanisms that could be applied to the proposed system\\u2019s design.

In this thesis we secure a home router and describe these steps to enable home and small business owners to secure their IPv6 network at a relatively low cost.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98295\", \"number-of-pages\": \"47\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:118\", \"keyword\": \"IPv6; security; home networks; small and medium sized enterprises\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-29T09:03:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-22T11:21:06.992+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:08:50.895+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98295\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 47.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:516976\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2000]]}, \"title\": \"Security in Wireless LAN Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Moioli\", \"given\": \"Fabio\", \"localId\": \"u1yac4jw\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Melen\", \"given\": \"Riccardo\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Politecnico di Milano\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Johnsson\", \"given\": \"Martin\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Business Networks\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Rinman\", \"given\": \"Martin\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Business Networks\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Wireless LAN technology offers high-speed, wireless connectivity that enables mobile computing in many different environments. Many new services will be provided by usage of wireless LANs in public, home and corporate scenarios. Example of remote services might be downloading a video stream from a remote server or accessing news from an e-magazine. Local services could consist in travel information at airports, hotel-facilities at hotels, and conference-update at conference centers, as well as buying a fresh drink in a store. Present wireless networks are based on IEEE 802.11 standard, operating in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz ISM band and providing a bitrate of 2 Mbps. A new version of the 802.11 standard (802.11b) already now allows a bitrate of up to 11 Mbps. Work is now in progress for a new high performance wireless LAN standard with initial data rates up to 54 Mbps. It will operate in the license free 5 GHz band, which is globally available.\\nSupport for IP mobility is also on the verge of hitting the market on a broad scale. The requirement for this feature stems from the fact that terminals such as laptops, notebooks, and even palmtops, are on their way to regularly being connected to LANs by means of previous wireless interface. In a longer term, IP mobility is also seen as a requirement for the next generation of cellular networks and (of course) also for next generation of wireless LANs, e.g. those based on the HiperLAN/2 technology. While Mobile IP should be part of an overall mobility suit solution, it is best used selectively and in pop-up mode (i.e. using DHCP to obtain addresses) instead of using a Foreign Agent. Using Foreign Agents may in fact add additional complexity to the network, which may already be using DHCP. Both Wireless LAN systems deployed today and the Mobile IP solutions specified by the IETF mobility working group implement and define different levels and parts of an overall security architecture. Current solutions lack an analysis of the security framework regarding requirements that would apply for the private, public, domestic, and VPN networking cases, which are quite different in their nature.\\nThe main goal of this thesis has consisted in analysing and defining several security proposals for future wireless LAN network scenarios. Advanced services, such as IP mobility, accounting support for roaming, VPN services, and a secure interface for dynamic assignment of IP addresses to mobile terminals (e.g. through DHCP or DRCP), have also been integrated in the overall framework.

The wide adoption of video surveillance systems by various businesses and individuals has raised some vital security issues. \\u00a0Appropriately addressing these security issues is of great importance for video surveillance systems, as these systems may capture sensitive personal data and may attract numerous attacks. As of today nearly all devices have become networked (or are on their way to being connected to networks), hence eavesdropping is a common attack which can exploit a breach of a system\\u2019s security and result in data disclosure to unauthorised parties, video stream alterations, interference, and reduction of a system\\u2019s performance. Moreover, it is important that video surveillance systems are standardized by appropriate standardization organizations in order to assure high quality of the security services that utilize these systems and to facilitate interoperability.In this master thesis project rules and regulations concerning personal data protection were studied in order to define the requirements of the proposed robust and high quality security scheme that is to be integrated into video surveillance systems. This security scheme provides United States Federal Information (FIPS)* compliant security services by securing the communication channel between the system\\u2019s devices. The authentication of the system\\u2019s devices is established by using certificates and key exchanges. The proposed security scheme has been scrutinized in order to analyze its performance (and efficiency) in terms of overhead, increased jitter, and one-way delay variations.&lt;p&gt; Our implementation of the proposed security scheme utilized OpenVPN to provide privacy, integrity and authentication to the video streaming captured by Veracity\\u2019s clients and stored in Veracity\\u2019s proprietary NAS device (COLDSTORE). Utilization of OpenSSL FIPS Object module develops our security scheme in a FIPS compliant solution. For testing purposes, we created different test scenarios and collected data about the total delivery time of a video file, delivered from the IPCamera/NVR/DVR devices to the COLDSTORE device, the network overhead and lastly the one-way delay between the two endpoints.Another area of interest that we focus on is how to deploy certificates to new, existing, and replacement devices; and how this deployment may affect the system\\u2019s security design. In addition, we investigate the problems arising when a secured video stream needs to be played back via another device outside of our system\\u2019s network.The results of the thesis will be used as an input for product development activities by the company that hosted this thesis project.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-143490\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiv,55\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2014:6\", \"keyword\": \"Video surveillance Systems; security; FIPS; OpenVNP; Video\\u00f6vervakningssystem; s\\u00e4kerhet; FIPS; OpenVPN\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-03-21T13:03:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-03-21T12:09:33.155+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T20:37:06.221+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-143490\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 69.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:949971\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2016]]}, \"title\": \"Security Management : Fulfillment of the Government Requirements for a component assurance process\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Kukuruzovic\", \"given\": \"Naida\", \"localId\": \"u1tfridt\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Muhovic\", \"given\": \"Admir\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Swedish Armed Forces\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Protecting organization\\u2019s assets from various security threats is a necessity for every organization. Efficient security management is vital to effectively protect the organization\\u2019s assets. However, the process of implementing efficient security management is complex and needs to address many requirements.The problem that this master\\u2019s thesis project addressed was to propose a component assurance process for the Swedish Armed Forces. This process has to be followed in order for a solution or product to be approved at a specific component assurance level. This problem was solved by first performing market research regarding security management. Various security management approaches were examined and the top security management solutions were selected. These solutions were then compared with the assurance requirements stated in Swedish Armed Forces\\u2019 KSF v3.1 (Swedish: \\u201cKrav p\\u00e5 IT-s\\u00e4kerhetsf\\u00f6rm\\u00e5gor hos IT-system\\u201d, English: Requirements for IT security capabilities of IT systems). This documentation lists the requirements for information technology (IT) security capabilities of IT systems. The solution that satisfied the most of these requirements was selected and modified in order to satisfy the full set of requirements. Finally, a component assurance process is proposed. This process may be used to decide which solutions or products can be used, along with the manner in which each solution or product should be used. The impact of having a component assurance process is that all the solutions and products are approved to a specific component assurance level exclusively based on this process. The ability to include such requirements in the acquisition of any product or service provides the Swedish Armed Forces with assurance that all products or services are approved to specific assurance levels in the same manner and hence provides the Swedish society with assurance that procedures within the Swedish Armed Forces are documented and protect the interests of the country and its citizens.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-189983\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xv,233\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2016:110\", \"keyword\": \"Security management; information security; authentication; authorization; governance; risk management; compliance; user management; S\\u00e4kerhetshantering; informationss\\u00e4kerhet; autentisering; auktorisering; styrning; riskhantering; f\\u00f6ljsamhet; anv\\u00e4ndaradministration\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2016-08-08T15:21:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2016-07-26T12:54:22.054+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-22T16:05:24.407+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-189983\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 248.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:634369\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2013]]}, \"title\": \"Security of NFC applications\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Pham\", \"given\": \"Thi Van Anh\", \"localId\": \"u198q5w4\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Aura\", \"given\": \"Tuomas\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Aalto University\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Tamrakar\", \"given\": \"Sandeep\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Aalto University\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Near Field Communication (NFC) refers to a communication technology that enables an effortless connection and data transfers between two devices by putting them in a close proximity. Besides contactless payment and ticketing applications, which were the original key drivers of this technology, a large number of novel use cases can benefit from this rapidly developing technology, as has been illustrated in various NFC-enabled application proposals and pilot trials.Typical NFC-enabled systems combine NFC tags, NFC-enabled mobile phones, and online servers. This thesis explores the trust relationships, security requirements, and security protocol design in these complex systems. We study how to apply the security features of different types of NFC tags to secure NFC applications. We first examine potential weaknesses and problems in some novel use cases where NFC can be employed. Thereafter, we analyze the requirements and propose our system design to secure each use case. In addition, we developed proof-of-concept implementations for two of our proposed protocols: an NFCenabled security-guard monitoring system and an NFC-enabled restaurant menu.For the former use case, we also formally verified our proposed security protocol.\\u00a0 Our analysis shows that among the discussed tags, the NFC tags based on secure memory cards have the least capability and flexibility. Their built-in three-pass mutual authentication can be used to prove the freshness of the event when the tag is tapped. The programmable contactless smart cards are more flexible because they can be programmed to implement new security protocols. In addition, they are able to keep track of a sequence number and can be used in systems that do not require application-specific software on the mobile phone. The sequence number enforces the order of events, thus providing a certain level of replay prevention. The most powerful type of tag is the emulated card since it provides a clock, greater computational capacity, and possibly its own Internet connection, naturally at higher cost of deployment.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-124368\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xii,88\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:125\", \"keyword\": \"NFC; security protocol; DESFire; Java card; card emulation; restaurant; vending machine; class attendance; security guard; NFC; s\\u00e4kerhetsprotokoll; DESFire; Java kort; kort emulering; restaurang; varuautomat; s\\u00e4kerhetsvakt\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-07-01T09:06:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-06-30T12:59:57.563+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T23:55:49.364+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-124368\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 100.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:515385\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2002]]}, \"title\": \"Selecting/realization of Virtual Private Networks with Multiprotocol Label Switching or Virtual Local Area Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"\\u00d6gren\", \"given\": \"Niklas\", \"localId\": \"u1tsypjb\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Eriksson\", \"given\": \"Peter\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Arrowhead\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Many reports have been written about the techniques behind Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS). They usually deal with the low level design of the software implementing a specific technique. The initial products are usually not mature enough to run in a large network or have to be adjusted in some way to fit.\\nThis report investigates the different ways of implementing strict layer 2 Virtual Private Networks in an existing nation-wide Gigabit Ethernet. The infrastructure in use, as well as the hardware, has to be used without major changes. Since 1998/1999, when MPLS first started in the laboratories, development has continued. Today it is possible to introduce MPLS or tunneled national virtual local area network into an existing network. This requires high speed, fault tolerant, and stable hardware and software.\\nGoing beyond the separation of traffic at layer 3 using Virtual Private Networks, i.e., IPSec, we can tunnel layer 2 traffic through a network. Although the first layer 3 VPN products are already in use, layer 2 VPNs still need to be evaluated and brought into regular use. There are currently two ways of tunneling VLANs in a core network: tunneled VLANs (or as Extreme Networks calls them, VMANs) and MPLS.\\nThis project showed that it is possible to start with a VLAN-only solution, and then upgrade to MPLS to solve scalability issues. The VMAN solution can not be used at Arrowhead, since there are too many disadvantages in the way Extreme Networks has implemented it. However, a mix of tunneling VMAN in a VLAN core is possible, and enables customer tagging of VLANs in a Layer 2 VPN. Furthermore, the testing of EAPS and per-VLAN Spanning Tree Protocol turned out well, and showed that EAPS should not be used when there is more than one loop.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93211\", \"number-of-pages\": \"65\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": \"VPN (Virtual Private Network); VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network); MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-13T14:59:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-12T16:27:02.880+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:56:27.294+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93211\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 65.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:541067\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2004]]}, \"title\": \"Service discovery for Personal Area Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Ayrault\", \"given\": \"C\\u00e9cile\", \"localId\": \"u1iw7ey5\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Kanter\", \"given\": \"Theo\", \"affiliation\": []}, {\"family\": \"Wennlund\", \"given\": \"Andreas\", \"affiliation\": []}], \"abstract\": \"With the increasing use of electronic devices, the need for affordable wireless services specifically context-aware services, in a so-called Personal Area Network (PAN) is becoming an area with significant potential.

Nowadays, VoIP is becoming more and more popular. People use VoIP to call their family and friends every day. It is cheap, especially when users are abroad, because that they do need to pay any roaming fee. Many companies also like their employees to use VoIP, not only because the cost of calling is cheap, but using VoIP means that the company does not need a hardware Private Branch eXchange (PBX) -- while potentially offering all of the same types of services that such a PBX would have offered. As a result the company can replace their hardware PBX with a powerful PC which has Private Branch eXchange PBX software to connect all the employees and their VoIP provider.\\nAt the VoIP provider\\u2019s side, the provider can provide cheap calls for all users which are connected by Internet. The users can initialize and tear down a session using a VoIP user agent, but how can they place a VoIP call from a mobile device or other devices without a VoIP user agent? Users want to place cheap VoIP call everywhere. VoIP providers want to provide flexible solution to attract and keep users. So they both want to the users to be able to place cheap VoIP call everywhere. Although VoIP user agent are available for many devices as a software running on a computer, a hardware VoIP phone, and even in some mobile devices. However, there are some practical problems with placing a VoIP call from everywhere. The first problem is that not every device can have a VoIP user agent. But if you do not have a VoIP user agent on your device, then it would seem to be difficult to place a VoIP call. The second problem is that you have to connect to a network (probably Internet) to signal that you want to place a call. Thus at a minimum your device has to support connecting to an appropriate network. If your device is connecting to a mobile network, you can send signaling to set up a VoIP call through General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). However, the bandwidth and delay of the GPRS networks of some mobile operators is not suitable for the transfer of encoded voice data, additionally, some mobile operators charge high fees for using GPRS. All of these problems make placing VoIP calls via a mobile device difficult. However, if your mobile device has a VoIP user agent and you have suitable connectivity, then you can easily use VoIP from your mobile device[.]\\nTo provide a flexible solution to VoIP everywhere -- even to devices that do not or can not have a VoIP user agent, Opticall AB has designed Dial over Data (DoD) solution. By using this solution, you can place a VoIP call from your mobile device or even fixed phone -- without requiring that the device that you use have a VoIP user agent. This solution also provides a central Internet Protocol-Private Branch eXchange (IP-PBX) which can connect call to and from to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) phones. Both individuals and companies can use this solution for call cost savings.\\nMax Weltz created the existing DoD solution in an earlier thesis project. This thesis [1] provides a good description of the existing DoD solution. As a result of continued testing and user feedback, Opticall AB has realized that their DoD solution needs to be improved in several area. This thesis project first identified some of the places where improvement was needed, explains why these improvements are necessary, and finally designs, implements, and evaluates these changes to confirm that they are improvements. An important result of this thesis project was a clear demonstration of improvements in configuration of the solution, better presentation of call data records, correct presentation of caller ID, and the ability to use a number of different graphical user interfaces with the improve DoD solution. These improvements should make this solution more attractive to the persons who have to maintain and operate the solution.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91493\", \"number-of-pages\": \"56\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2009:104\", \"keyword\": \"VoIP; SIP; Asterisk; Symbian; JavaEE; JBoss; DoD\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-16T12:00:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-16T11:34:35.991+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:22:37.626+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91493\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 56.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:514606\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2004]]}, \"title\": \"Service Policy Management for User-Centric Services in Heterogeneous Mobile Networks,\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Avgeropoulos\", \"given\": \"Konstantinos\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Kanter\", \"given\": \"Theo G.\", \"localId\": \"u10l6taa\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Research\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Wennlund\", \"given\": \"Andreas\", \"localId\": \"u1al7w08\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6215\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a signaling protocol for IP-based media services that will be the de facto standard for future media-over-IP services.

The Signaling System number 7 (SS7) is used in fixed and wireless networks and is needed for call control and services such as caller ID, roaming, and for sending SMS. The traditional SS7 networks are expensive to lease and to expand, hence a new suite of protocols have been designed to carry signaling messages over IP. This suite contains a transport protocol called Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) and various user adaptation layer protocols such as M2PA, M2UA, M3UA, and SUA. To transport the highly loss and delay sensitive signaling messages over IP, it is mandatory that the transport protocol meets the high performance requirements of SS7. Not before the IP-solution has been tested in detail, will it replace significant parts of the national telephone network.In this thesis, the failover duration in the case of link failure was tested using the feature of SCTP called multi-homing.

IP-telephony solutions exist already in some business buildings as a replacement for PSTN or on the Internet as IP-to-IP telephony. However, before IP-telephony will be a realistic replacement for PSTN two major problems must be solved though; billing and guarantee of the expected QoS. Without the possibility of revenue no company would like to invest money and without QoS no customer will want to replace PSTN with IP-telephony. IP-to-IP telephony exists with best effort traffic for free today, and it will not be possible to charge for it in the future. By introducing value-added features such as PSTN gateway connection, bandwidth reservation and services such as call screening and redirecting, a way of charging the customer is presented in this report.\\nThe payment solution developed in this thesis is based on SIP and Jalda. The system is built in modules, all with a specific task, hence creating a distributed system, which does not depend on a central part, and following existing standards, avoiding a proprietary solution. It is also general enough to support other types of media than speech, enabling several business ideas including video on demand.\\nSecurity has to be considered seriously when dealing with Internet payments. The solution presented contains both the advantages of SIP with authentication and message encryption, as well as authentication and accounting by Jalda. Authorization is not a problem, as no one will get access to the services without paying, and anyone willing to pay will be granted access. It ends up being a distributed payment solution.\\nSIP has the necessary characteristics for constructing billing solutions. As payment seems to be a solvable problem there remains one major difficulty with IP-telephony.

Today Network address translation (NAT) traversal has become the main obstruction for future VoIP deployment.\\nIn this thesis we analyze and compare the existing NAT traversal solutions. Following this, we introduce a VoIP over IPSec (VOIPSec) solution (i.e., a VoIP over IPSec virtual private network (VPN) scheme) and an extended VOIPSec solution mechanism. These two solutions were tested and compared to measure their performance in comparison to a version of the same Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) user agent running without IPSec.\\nIn the proposed VOIPSec solution, the IPSec VPN tunnel connects each of the SIP clients to a SIP server, thus making all of the potential SIP participants reachable, i.e., solving the NAT traversal problem. All SIP signaling and media traffic for VoIP calls are transmitted through this prior established tunnel. This VPN tunnel provides the desired universal means for VoIP traffic to traverse NAT equipment. Additionally, the IPSec VPN also guarantees the security of VoIP calls at the IP level.\\nIn order to improve the security level of media streams for the VOIPSec solution, we deployed and evaluated an extended VOIPSec solution which provides end-to-end protection of the real time media traffic. In this extended VOIPSec solution, we used SRTP instead of RTP to carry the media content. This extended method was shown to provide all of the advantages of VOIPSec and SRTP without any additional delay for the media traffic (as compared to the VoIPSec solution).\\nNote that the solution proposed in this thesis may be of limited practical importance in the future as more NATs become VoIP capable; but the solution is currently essential for facilitating the increasing deployment of VoIP systems in practice. For VoIP calls that do not need end-to-end security, we recommend the use of the VOIPSec solution as a means to solve the NAT traversal problem and to protect traffic at the IP level. When application to application security is not needed we prefer the VOIPSec solution to the extended VOIPSec solution for the following reasons: (1) our test results show that the time for call setup for the extended VOIPSec solution is twice time the time needed for the VOIPSec solution and the extended VOIPSec solution requires the use of user agents that support SRTP. While, the VOIPSec solution does not require a special user agent and all VoIP clients in the market are compatible with this solution. However, when more SIP user agents add support for SRTP, the extended VOIPSec solution will be applicable for users of these SIP user agents.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91491\", \"number-of-pages\": \"55\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2009:105\", \"keyword\": \"VOIPSec; NAT; IPSec; SIP; SRTP; VPN\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-16T14:42:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-16T11:06:54.056+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:22:44.659+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91491\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 55.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:540129\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"Small Cell Wireless Backhaul in Mobile Heterogeneous Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Legonkov\", \"given\": \"Pavel\", \"localId\": \"u1xqut4h\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Prokopov\", \"given\": \"Vasily\", \"localId\": \"u1bcsk9j\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Welin\", \"given\": \"Annikki\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Small cells are deployed in a crowded areas with a high demand for both coverage and capacity.

The performance of wireless equipment manufactured by several vendors has been measured. The results of these measurements were analyzed and compared to a set of requirements established for small cell backhaul. The analysis has affirmed that IEEE 802.11n is capable of providing sufficient performance to be used for small cell backhaul in various deployment scenarios.

In addition to protecting the backhaul link itself, the security research investigated the safety of the whole mobile network architecture remodeled with the introduction of small cells. A mechanism to integrate secure small cells into a mobile network was developed.The results obtained during the project will be used as an input for product development activities in the company hosting the project.

The idea of the project concerns how to increase production packaging efficiency by introducing a control system. After taking an in-depth look at the current production environment, the following system goals were defined: packaging time reduction, cost reduction, decrease in human errors, and reducing the number of customer complaints. To achieve these goals, the thesis project was divided into the following tasks: discovering a feasible solution, actual system development, testing, and evaluation. The proposed system is based on hardware (i.e. barcode scanner, and barcode printer) integrated with customized control software. The barcode scanner acts as a bridge between the system and the production process by scanning a barcode printed on each product. The system prints the required information label for the product\\u2019s package according to the scanned product. This label is pasted on the product\\u2019s box and is used as a tracking tool during further production steps. The system is very flexible and suits any packaging model. Other functional properties maintained in the system include data security, product traceability, and real time production monitoring. Testing of the system was done in an actual production environment at an Oberthur Technologies manufacturing site. Two production lines were selected to test the system\\u2019s functionality, specifically the SIM card production packaging line and the Scratch card/ Bank Card production packaging line. The results obtained during the evaluation phase of the proposed system show that the proposed solution decreased the packaging processing time by (27.3%) over the previous values.

As a result NFC has a huge potential to simplify our everyday tasks, ranging from paying for items to accessing our office or home.In this context we will focus on using NFC together with a Power over Ethernet (PoE) powered circuit board and NFC reader to realize a simple system for granting access to open a locked door.

These devices make use of the resources offered by Universal Mobile Telecommunication Services (UMTS) networks toaccess on-line services such as web browsing, e-mail, audio and video streaming, etc. UMTS networks have to deal with an increasing amount of data traffic generated by smartphones. Because of the fact that the smartphone is battery powered and is trying to satisfy the needs ofboth applications and human users there is a need to be smarter about how to manage both network and terminal resources.This thesis explores the possibility of making a better use of the network and terminal resources by exploiting correlations in the events of the smartphone-generated traffic. We propose a mechanism, through which the network can predict if a terminal is going to produce data transmission or reception in a near future, based on past events in its traffic. According to this prediction, the network will be able to decide if it keeps or releases the resources allocated to the terminal. We analyze the benefits from the network and the terminal point ofview. We also describe a method to estimate an upper bound of the time until the next transmission or reception of data in a near future.We show that it is possible a reduction of the time that each terminal wastes in its maximum power consumption state, but this reduction implies a penalty in the transmission/reception throughput of the terminal. The reduction is not uniform for all terminals: terminals whose traffic presents a predictable behavior gain the most. Estimates of upper bounds of time until the next transmission or reception are more accurate if they are made taking as input information about interarrival times of previous packets.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91051\", \"number-of-pages\": \"76\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2011:174\", \"keyword\": \"Smartphones; traffic patterns; UMTS\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-07T08:18:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-06T17:08:03.345+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:31:47.560+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91051\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 76.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:538921\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1994]]}, \"title\": \"SNMP Application for the MINT Router (Walkstation II project)\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Oelhafen\", \"given\": \"Markus\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Humblet\", \"given\": \"Pierre\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Institut EURECOM\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The purpose of the Walkstation II project is to create a testbed for a wireless communication system with access to the Internet.

Because of this people expect these social networking services to be available on their mobile device, as well as on their personal computer.

By integrating the contacts gained from the social networking service into the mobile phonebook the user can reach these contacts easily.\\nCommunication in online social networks via a mobile phone is expected to grow in popularity in the near future [1]. Several operators are simplifying access to these networks for their customers by offering different ways to connect to social networks [2][3]. However, access to these networks is often done via web sites or dedicated applications. These solutions are not optimal since browsing the web using a mobile browser can be bothersome and dedicated applications require installation of the application as well as any subsequent updates. Widgets on the other hand solve these problems in a convenient way. They can enable access to a device\\u2019s full functionality, just like dedicated applications, and provide a platform for easy development using web technologies. Furthermore, widgets are highly flexible for example, updates do not require reinstallation, and when new social networks become popular new widgets that connect to them can easily be developed and distributed.\\nThe goal of this thesis is to expand the mobile phonebook with functionality to enable communication on online social networks. To reach this goal I have created a new widget platform, where hybrid widgets run partly in a Java ME application and partly in the mobile web browser. This solution has the potential to significantly enhance the ways we communicate and interact with people.

It takes advantage of multiple built-in sensors, along with internet connectivity, to provide a variety of services including navigation, weather forecasts, media capturing/sharing, and many more. The smartphone has become a hub for our social interactions, ranging from traditional voice communications through messaging, to online social networking.There are endless possibilities for a new generation of applications that automatically adapts according to users\\u2019 social affinities. The key enabler is to understand the social profile of the user and to realize a Social Proximity Indicator (SPI). This indicator of a user\\u2019s social profile includes the user\\u2019s location, preferences, common friends, frequent interactions among friends, community membership, and many more attributes. This project addresses the exploitation of the user\\u2019s smartphone as a detector of these user\\u2019s social contexts in order to infer the social proximity between any 2 (or more) people. The goal of this social proximity indicator is to identify the (current) set of smartphone users that would want to participate in an application specific activity, such as media sharing, group conversation, etc. SPI identifies users based on their social interactions and common preferences.Based on this SPI, a photo sharing application is proposed and built for the Android smartphone platform. This application uses multiple physical and virtual sensors (hosted by the user\\u2019s smartphone) to determine the context of the user. After inferring this context, the application initiates photo sharing among an identified group sharing this context. The application, as well as the underlying code, theoretical concepts, and results are presented in this thesis. The experiments conducted during this thesis project indicate that it is feasible to build smartphone based social proximity based applications in which proximity incorporates much more than simply physical location, thus going beyond existing applications.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-147677\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xviii,95\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2014:66\", \"keyword\": \"Social Proximity; Smartphone; Social Interactions; Image sharing; Virtual Sensors; Social N\\u00e4rhet; Smartphone; sociala interaktioner; bild delning; virtuella sensorer\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-07-01T18:54:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-07-01T16:20:58.753+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T19:26:27.582+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-147677\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 113.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:608135\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2013]]}, \"title\": \"Socio-economic Impact of Fiber to the Home in Sweden\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Xiong\", \"given\": \"Ziyi\", \"localId\": \"u1x6i0yi\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Forzati\", \"given\": \"Marco\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Acreo AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) has been talked about since the introduction of fiberin the 1970s. It is nowadays shaping up to be the foundation of our newdigital society, bringing economic prosperity and a multitude of business,social, and entertainment opportunities to its users. The increased consumerdemand for high-speed network accessibility is being taken more and moreseriously and a fiber-based network is able to cope with these growing demandsdue to its wide bandwidth and reliability. Today there is a practical need forquantitative analysis regarding the socio-economic impacts of fiber-basedaccess networks. This analysis could be used as an indicator/reference for allthe stakeholder entities as they consider future investments anddevelopments. Sweden is a suitable target country for this analysis since ithas adopted fiber for some years and the benefits that FTTH has brought seemto already be tangible.The primary value of this thesis lies ininvestigation of its quantified evidence of the socio-economic impacts of FTTHdeployment in Sweden. This has been achieved based on data from the SwedishPost and Telecommunications Authority (PTS), Statistics Sweden (SCB), previousrelated studies, and information collected on-line from operators involved inthe fiber market, along with empirical analysis based on multivariateregression models.The results of the study show that fiber penetrationhas had a significant impact on the population\\u2019s evolution, specially the netamount of migration into a municipality, which indicates the attractiveness ofmunicipalities per se. It is therefore reasonable to suggest that localgovernment and local authorities take fiber deployment into consideration, ifthey want to attract people to stay for further local development. The studyalso analyzed the competition in fiber-based open networks and the prices ofsubscribing for 10/10 Mbps symmetrical Internet Service. Study findingsrevealed that networks with multiple competing service providers have a widerrange of services and a lower price: the more ISPs competing in a fibernetwork, the lower consumer prices. Specifically, for each new serviceprovider present in the network, there will be 5 SEK per month decrease of theaverage price of the Internet services, and an approximately 7 SEK per monthreduction in the lowest price.Nevertheless, a number of socio-economicimpacts remain unquantifiable as of the current time and due to the limitedavailable data.

These bugs are usually due to errors and mistakes made by programmers while writing the code or writing the specifications. No tool is able to detect all of these bugs. Some of these bugs remain undetected despite testing of the code. For these reasons, many researchers have tried to find indicators in the software\\u2019s source codes that can be used to predict the presence of bugs.Every bug in the source code is a potentially failure of the program to perform as expected. Therefore, programs are tested with many different cases in an attempt to cover all the possible paths through the program to detect all of these bugs. Early prediction of bugs informs the programmers about the location of the bugs in the code. Thus, programmers can more carefully test the more error prone files, and thus save a lot of time by not testing error free files.This thesis project created a tool that is able to predict error prone source code written in C++. In order to achieve this, we have utilized one predictor which has been extremely well studied: software metrics. Many studies have demonstrated that there is a relationship between software metrics and the presence of bugs. In this project a Neuro-Fuzzy hybrid model based on Fuzzy c-means and Radial Basis Neural Network has been used. The efficiency of the model has been tested in a software project at Ericsson. Testing of this model proved that the program does not achieve high accuracy due to the lack of independent samples in the data set.

Although these devices are personal, often a small set of persons can use a given device, for example a group of friends or a family.The most natural way to communicate for most humans is through speech. Therefore a natural way for these devices to know who is using them is for the device to listen to the user\\u2019s speech, i.e., to recognize the speaker based upon their speech.This project exploits the microphone built into most of these devices and asks whether it is possible to develop an effective speaker recognition system which can operate within the limited resources of these devices (as compared to a desktop PC). The goal of this speaker recognition is to distinguish between the small set of people that could share a handheld device and those outside of this small set. Therefore the criteria is that the device should work for any of the members of this small set and not work for anyone outside of this small set. Furthermore, within this small set the device should recognize which specific person within this small group is using it.An application for a Windows Mobile PDA has been developed using C++. This application and its underlying theoretical concepts, as well as parts of the code and the results obtained (in terms of accuracy rate and performance) are presented in this thesis. The experiments conducted within this research indicate that it is feasible to recognize the user based upon their speech is within a small group and further more to identify which member of the group is the user.

The radio spectrum is a limited resource regulated by governmental agencies according to a fixed spectrum assignment policy. However, many studies show that this fixed radio frequency allocation leads to significant underutilization of the radio spectrum creating artificial scarcity, as most of the allocated spectrum is not used all of the time in every location. To meet services growing demands, efficient use of the spectrum is essential. Therefore, there is a need to estimate the radio spectrum utilization in several locations and during different periods of time in order to opportunistically exploit the existing wireless spectrum. Cognitive radio technology aims to search for those portions of the radio spectrum that are assigned to a specific service, but are unused during a specific time and at specific location in order to share these white spaces and thus to reduce the radio spectrum inefficiency.In this thesis, we study spectrum utilization in the frequency range from 790MHz to 925MHz. The spectrum sensing has been realized using a number of specialized microcontroller based white space sensors which utilize energy detection, situated in different locations of a building in Kista, Sweden. The occupancy of the frequency bands in this chunk of the spectrum is quantified as the fraction of samples with a power level greater than a threshold. The results from these spectrum measurements show that a significant amount of spectrum in this scanned range around the building is inefficiently used all the time.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-124555\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xi,64\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:177\", \"keyword\": \"Cognitive radio; spectrum sensing; dynamic spectrum access; radio spectrum utilization; Kognitiv radio; spectrum sensing; dynamiskt spektrum tillg\\u00e5ng; radiospektrum utnyttjas\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-07-11T08:36:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-07-10T16:29:42.135+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T23:51:41.781+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-124555\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 75.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:513122\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2005]]}, \"title\": \"Speech Interface for a Mobile Audio Application\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Sverin\", \"given\": \"Johan\", \"localId\": \"u1mol7tc\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Today almost everyone owns a mobile phone, adults along with teenagers and kids.

The educational goal is to de-mystifying radio and other link and physical layer communication technologies as the students can follow packets from the higher layers down through the physical layer and back up again.\\nThe thesis fills the gap between the existing documentation for the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) resources and the knowledge of undergraduate students. This was necessary because the existing document is targeted at advanced audiences rather than undergraduates. This thesis describes the design and evolution of a workbench for students to experiment with a variety of media access and control protocols, much as Wireshark gives students the ability to watch network and higher layer protocols. Another motivation for this thesis is that an increasing number of communication networks use complex media access and control protocols and existing tools do not allow students to see the details of what is taking place in these protocols, except via simulation. Today an software defined radio and computer are affordable as laboratory equipment for an undergraduate course. Hence the time is ripe for the development of undergraduate laboratory course material using these tools.\\nThe thesis is targeted at (1) instructors of undergraduates who might use this work to develop their own lesson plans and course material and (2) students of physical and link layer protocols who want a practical tool for carrying out experiments in these layers. Hopefully by de-mystifying these lower layers and by making the USRP more approachable by undergraduate students we will encourage lots of students to view wireless network technology as being just as approachable as a wired Ethernet.\\nDue to the widespread use of wireless communications technologies, there is a great need by industry for more graduates who can understand communication systems from the physical to the application layer - rather than the current situation where there is a hard boundary between the lower two layers and the upper layers. While there has been a lot of research concerning cross layer optimization, much of this is theoretical and not very approachable by students. A desired outcome of this thesis project is that undergraduate students will be able to understand tradeoffs at all layers of the protocol stack and not be limited to the upper layers.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91193\", \"number-of-pages\": \"82\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2009:206\", \"keyword\": \"GNU Radio; USRP; MAC; Bluetooth; IEEE 802.11\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-09T14:54:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-09T14:45:47.711+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:28:49.816+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91193\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 82.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:528541\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1998]]}, \"title\": \"S.U.N.E. - Secure User Network Environment\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"H\\u00f6gstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Andreas\", \"localId\": \"u1vmo2kx\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}, {\"family\": \"\\u00c5sbrink\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"localId\": \"u1kcus38\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Mild\", \"given\": \"Michal\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"SoftWell AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"In today's society, an increasing number of people geographically apart need to communicate to each other in a secure manner.

Within these standards the role played by power consumption is implicit, hence power consumption needs to be as low as possible in order to fulfill long-life requirements and to offer the opportunity of locating and moving smart objects in the coverage area while relying only on batteries as the device's power source.\\u00a0 Considering the importance of identifying and tracking these smart objects with high accuracy and high precision, this document propose an implementation of an IEEE 802.15.4a MAC layer, exploiting ultra-wideband wireless technology, with a time synchronization algorithm included for precise Time Difference of Arrival indoor positioning.Nevertheless, this thesis demonstrates the advantages of using UWB for indoor wireless communication, due to its accuracy in localization and its robustness against interference.A demonstration network has been analyzed consisting of four main base stations optimistically displaced at the corners of a room gathering timestamps from a central tag moving within the space where the UWB signal is within range. These timestamps are collected in one of the base station which plays the role of the coordinator and sends this information to a server which computes the position of the tag using TDOA formulation.The main focus of this work is the synchronization algorithms used to synchronize the four base stations and secondly to synchronize the coordinator with the tag. Particular interest is placed on the protocol, the kind of messages exchanged, and the procedure used to maintain a good level of synchronization and to avoid unwanted clock drifts.Moreover the thesis gives some hints of potential future improvements and proposes a possible solution for large-scale scenarios involving the installation of additional base stations for higher coverage and integration of a larger number of tags, with a focus on synchronization, collision avoidance, and routing procedures to better Fit the situation of a larger network and more tags.\\u00a0 As a result, all the assumptions and the methodologies applied give evidence of how difficult it is to meet contemporary requirements for position accuracy, low power consumption, limited memory, and small message exchange when utilizing low-power and lossy networks and to address problems which need to be further studied in the future. The results of this thesis project offer a good proof of the possibility to reach high accuracy in terms of localization when exploiting UWB radio technology and redundant time synchronization algorithms with the help of TDOA measurements.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-120580\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xvii,79\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:59\", \"keyword\": \"IEEE 802.15.4a; synchronization; time delay of arrival; ultra-wideband; IEEE 802.15.4a; synkronisering; tidsf\\u00f6rdr\\u00f6jning f\\u00f6r ankomst; ultrabredbandsteknik\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-04-15T09:53:42.507+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-04-11T16:48:54.642+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T00:43:25.055+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-120580\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 96.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:402380\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2011]]}, \"title\": \"S\\u00e4ker grannuppt\\u00e4ck i IPv6\", \"language\": \"swe\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Huss\", \"given\": \"Philip\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The IPv6 protocol offers with some new functions, one of them is auto configuration. With auto configuration it is possible for nodes, i.e. hosts and routers, for automatically associated with IPv6 addresses without manual configuration. Auto configuration it is another protocol as it uses Neighbor Discovery protocol (ND) messages (ND is mandatory in the IPv6 stack). The main purpose of ND is that nodes can discover other nodes on the local link, perform address resolution, check that addresses are unique, and check the reachability with active nodes.There are exactly the same vulnerabilities of IPv6 as IPv4 and is now exception, ND if not properly secured. IPsec is a standard security mechanism for IPv6 but it does not solve the problem of secure auto configuration due the bootstrapping problem. Therefore the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) introduced Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND). SEND is a mechanism for authentication, message protection, and router authentication.

In some cases the partial ATCP implementation increases throughput but more often it causes an increased amount of duplicate retransmissions. In these scenarios it is unlikely that even a complete ATCP implementation would increase throughput performance.A few modifications to ATCP and TCP are analysed.

One reason why TCP might encounter problems in such an environment is rapid changes of the link characteristics. These rapid changes can occur due to handover between two subnetworks (macro handover), e.g., when a mobile node switches between different access networks. A possible and realistic handover scenario could be when a mobile node is roaming between a high bandwidth local area network (LAN) with limited coverage and a low bandwidth radio link with wide area coverage.\\nThe goals of this thesis were to set up a realistic environment for measurements of the handover performance of TCP, and to observe TCP behavior when the link characteristics suddenly change. Further objectives were to analyze the results and propose solutions for improving the performance.\\nThe mobility management in the measurement setup is handled by Mobile IP. Handovers are performed between a wireless LAN (WaveLAN) and a PPP link over a GSM circuit switched data connection. Our investigation shows that several spurious TCP timeouts occur after handover from the fast link to the slow link, triggering unnecessary retransmissions and hence resulting in TCP performance degradation. To avoid unnecessary retransmissions, we suggest a resetting of the retransmission timeout value (RTO) at the moment of handover.\\nIn the case of handover from the low bandwidth link (PPP) to the high bandwidth link (WaveLAN), our measurements show that queued packets in the link layer buffer continue to flow over the PPP link even after the handover. The high bandwidth available after the switch is thus poorly utilized before the buffer of the low bandwidth link has been emptied. The IP sending process should delay putting packets in the queue of a slow link, thus avoiding large link layer queues and enabling utilization of the high bandwidth link faster. This could be achieved by flow control between the IP layer and the link layer. After the packets have started flowing over the WaveLAN, the RTO value is unnecessarily high, which could result in extensive delays in the case of packet losses. To alleviate the problems we recommend resetting the RTO value or modifying the algorithm for calculating the RTO value to faster adapt to sudden and significant decrease of the round-trip time (RTT) in the case of handover.\\nIn both handover scenarios mentioned above we have found that a small window size is favorable to mitigate the negative effects due to the rapid changes of the link characteristics. The use of Active Queue Management to avoid large window sizes would be an interesting approach for future investigations. Another interesting approach could be to have flow control between the IP layer and the link layer to avoid a large link layer queue when the handover from [one link to another occurs.]\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95138\", \"number-of-pages\": \"55\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": \"TCP; mobile IP\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-20T16:28:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-05-14T14:08:37.241+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:36:17.844+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95138\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 55.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:528325\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"TCP/IP Packet Flow Analyser\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Pour Rajaei\", \"given\": \"Rama\", \"localId\": \"u1xfzijk\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Rimbark\", \"given\": \"Mattias\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Telecom AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This is the final version of my thesis project: TCP/IP Packet Flow Analyser.

The Network Managers need this kind of \\u201ccontrol\\u201d over the network traffic to be able to deliver cost effective solutions for increasing network bandwidth and better allocation of bandwidth to users, proactively monitor critical network links i.e links that are in need of more bandwidth or that are \\u201cabnormally\\u201d faulty, computing resources used by a host or host pairs, etc.\\nTo be able to address these requirements and the fact that TCP/IP traffic is increasing, Ericsson Telecom AB which were developing an ATM Switch, called AXD 301, were very anxious to see if and how one can add the traffic flow analysing functionality to the switch by using an already existing circuit board. The design had to be adapted to the constrains of the circuit board, and thereby limited to a principle functionality of a traffic analyser. The analyser should also have the ability to send the collected data about the TCP/IP traffic to a regular work station equipped with an ATM card using a protocol specified by me.The functionality of the analyser was programmed in C and executed an embedded PowerPC.\\nThe main insufficiency of the current design was the packet analysing speed. It was able to run with a bandwidth of approximately 114 to 240 Mbps. To improve the performance in a packet analysing speed point of view, some alternative ways to implement the analyser with more help from the hardware was proposed.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95441\", \"number-of-pages\": \"40\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-20T16:32:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-05-24T17:58:54.604+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:30:00.118+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95441\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 40.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:524296\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"Telecommunication Services\\u2019 Migration to the Cloud : Network Performance analysis\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Albarr\\u00e1n Munoz\", \"given\": \"Isaac\", \"localId\": \"u1zfon6l\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Parras Ruiz De Az\\u00faa\", \"given\": \"Manuel\", \"localId\": \"u1uklj56\", \"affiliation\": []}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Johansson\", \"given\": \"Leif Y.\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Tikekar\", \"given\": \"Nikhil\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Nowadays, telecommunication services are commonly deployed in private networks, which are controlled and maintained by the telecommunication operators themselves, by co-location services providers, or, to some extent, by their hardware and software providers.

The purpose of a compression algorithm is to decrease the size of a set of time series data (such as vehicle speed, wheel speed, etc.) so that the data to be transmitted from the vehicle is small size, thus decreasing the cost of transmission while providing potentially better offboard data analysis. The project helped improve the quality of data collected by the data analysts and reduced the cost of data transmission. Since the time series data compression mostly concerns data storage and transmission, the difficulties in this project were where to locate the combination of data compression and transmission, within the limited performance of the onboard embedded systems. These embedded systems have limited resources (concerning hardware and software resources). Hence the efficiency of the compression algorithm becomes very important. Additionally, there is a tradeoff between the compression ratio and real-time performance. Moreover, the error rate introduced by the compression algorithm must be smaller than an expected value. The compression algorithm contains two phases: (1) an online lossy compression algorithm - piecewise approximation to shrink the total number of data samples while maintaining a guaranteed precision and (2) a lossless compression algorithm \\u2013 Delta-XOR encoding to compress the output of the lossy algorithm. The algorithm was tested with four typical time series data samples from real CAN logs with different functions and properties. The similarities and differences between these logs are discussed. These differences helped to determine the algorithms that should be used. After the experiments which helped to compare different algorithms and check their performances, a simulation is implemented based on the experiment results. The results of this simulation show that the combined compression algorithm can meet the need of certain compression ratio by controlling the error bound. Finally, the possibility of improving the compression algorithm in the future is discussed.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-239065\", \"number-of-pages\": \"76\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2018:722\", \"keyword\": \"Data compression; Data transmission; Time series data; IoT; CAN; Vehicle connectivity; Datakomprimering; Data\\u00f6verf\\u00f6ring; Tidsseriedata; IoT; CAN; Uppkopplade fordon\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-11-16T07:08:13.355+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-11-16T07:07:52.624+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T18:31:28.644+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-239065\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 76.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:516842\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2000]]}, \"title\": \"The Effect of Combining Network and Server QoS Parameters on End-to-End Performance\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Fey\", \"given\": \"Enik\\u00f6\", \"localId\": \"u1bg7y8h\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Rooney\", \"given\": \"Sean\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"IBM Z\\u00fcrich Research Laboratory\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Application hosting is becoming a popular business, Application Service Providers (ASPs) need however to keep up with the increasing pace of the market. This implies that they have to provide infrastructure to an increasing number of clients, and at the same time give QoS guarantees to these clients. One solution for ASPs to both guarantee a certain service level (QoS) for their clients and keep expanding would be to have so many resources as to be able to provide more than the maximum aggregate need of their clients. This may turn out to be an expensive or even an impossible solution - sharing infrastructure between clients and offering some means of resource reservation, and using charging to insure that clients only reserve the resources they need, is an alternative.\\nIt is however not an easy problem to solve, particularly if the procedure of adding new clients is to be automated, and the resources dynamically allocated. The ICorpMaker framework being developed at the IBM Zurich Research Laboratory offers a solution to the above named problems. In the ICorpMaker framework dynamic resource allocation is achieved by letting clients modify the amount of resources allocated to them in a simple manner, requesting more or less resources than their current allotment.\\nThe difficulty in achieving the end-to-end performance the client desires, lies in the fact that it is not certain how modifying resource allocation at the network respectively server level will combine and affect the end-to-end performance experienced by the end users of the service. The aim of this thesis project was to study the correlation between different network and server QoS parameters and the resulting end-to-end performance by making measurements. The results obtained from these measurements give an answer to the question of how to change the network and server resource allocations, when a client's application does not perform in a satisfactory way and hence the client requests more resources.

In contrast with the earlier generations of circuit-switched mobile networks, LTE is all-IP packet-switched network. Both voice and data are sent inside IP packets. Voice over IP (VoIP) is used to provide voice service to LTE users. The speech frames are encapsulated into real-time protocol (RTP) packets and sent over the network. The underlying UDP and IP layers prepend their headers to this small RTP packet resulting in a relatively high overhead. The small size of the RTP packets containing voice/audio leads to an overhead problem as the protocol overhead is in addition to the large LTE frame overhead, thus wasting network resources. This master\\u2019s thesis project proposes to multiplex RTP and data packets at the user\\u2019s device as a solution to reduce the overhead. Moreover, the capability of modern user devices to switch between several interfaces (such as LTE and WLAN), is taken into account and the multiplexing of multiple traffic flows or a single traffic flow are studied in the case of a vertical handover. Performance and cost metrics are used to evaluate different potential demultiplexing points, and then the best possible demultiplexing point is identified. The results of this evaluation show that several demultiplexing points can be used based on the operator\\u2019s needs. The increased packet payload size increases the energy efficiency of LTE and may avoid the need of the UE to switch to WLAN to save power. In addition, to ensure high quality of service for VoIP traffic, the simultaneous use of multiple interfaces is efficient if the multiplexer is enabled.

Furthermore, the client should present the content in an innovative way and allow the development of a mobile platform that could be supported based upon advertising, with an approach based on using information about the user (i.e. favorite places or profile details)as well as content-based advertising.In addition to the client application, the development of this subproject includes the development of a series of server-side utilities for the uploading and elaboration of publications on the server infrastructure.The document first reviews e-reading systems, focusing on the ePub file definition and e-reading solutions currently in use. The report then describes the Android OS development environment. The document then explains the implementation for both client and server side applications, giving a detailed overview of the chosen strategies and of the applications' structure. Finally the report concludes with a list of the achieved goals, a discussion on the project's limitations and then an exploration on what is the future for this client application.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91043\", \"number-of-pages\": \"63\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2011:249\", \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-07T08:29:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-06T15:47:37.281+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:32:01.222+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91043\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 63.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:468239\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2011]]}, \"title\": \"The Leaf Project : An E-Reading Platform Business Plan\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Botero Aristiz\\u00e1bal\", \"given\": \"Diego Fernando\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The publishing industry is rapidly changing, especially due to the commoditization of portable devices that enable ubiquitous access to information. E-publishing content is a business that is still in an early stage, which means that there are a lot of opportunities for start-ups to come up with innovative business models to challenge the traditional way of publishing content.The Leaf Project intends to create an e-reading platform that will offer the possibility to stream e-books to computers, tablets, and smartphones. Most options available in the market offer customers the option of buying e-publishing content on an individual basis. However, as seen in the music and movies industry, users tend to access pirate content, unless they see extra benefits in a paid service. Initially, the Leaf Project will offer free content, such as the public domain books that are part of the Project Gutenberg. This will allow us to get real market feedback and gain users. Users will be able to use the platform to publish content, having the option to select between \\u201cnot-for-profit\\u201d and \\u201cfor-profit\\u201d, depending on whether they want to receive royalties for the content they publish. The service will be based on a freemium business model, in which premium users will pay a flat rate rather than per item, in a similar way Spotify and Netflix have done for music and movies. Additionally, in the future we plan to create a community in which writers will be able to establish contact with artists and developers that will help them to enrich their e-books, which will in turn increase the value offered by the content that will be available via the platform.This master\\u2019s thesisis part of the Leaf Project, and it constitutes the business plan for the e-reading platform. The first part explains the different stages in the start-up process, as well as how to evaluate an innovative business idea. Then the business idea is described and the e-reading industry is analyzed to show how attractive this market is. An analysis of the risks that the company might face is performed, and different financial aspects required to operate the company are listed. The report finishes with the conclusions about the outcome of the thesis project as well as with suggestions for future work.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-52917\", \"number-of-pages\": \"64\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2011:268\", \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-12-20T15:10:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-12-20T15:10:12.048+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T19:03:11.060+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-52917\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 64.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:507859\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2011]]}, \"title\": \"The Leaf Project : E-Reading Platform Commercialization Plan\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Khalil\", \"given\": \"George\", \"localId\": \"u1r3mc7r\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The publishing industry currently faces a re-birth due to the rise of Information Technology (IT),which has created new production and distribution channels.

The Leaf Project aims to position itself in the publishing industry by creating a new business start-up exploiting this IT revolution.We divide the publishing industry into three different parts:<ul><li>Production is concerned about content creation and acquisition.</li><li>Distribution concerns delivering the content to consumers.</li><li>Access and presentation is about how the content is presented to consumers and how they can access this content.</li></ul>In The Leaf Project we are developing a new way to distribute publications, along with creating an end user interface to browse and access this content. The project is divided into four different masters theses. One is concerned with creating the distribution network, and another is concerned with creating the end user interface. This thesis provides a market analysis and proposes a business model. The fourth thesis will consolidate the complete project by developing a business plan.When looking into the three different parts of the publishing industry, this commercialization plan first benchmarks the proposed end user application and the distribution network by comparing them with currently marketed products. Following this the thesis will examine what is the best content that could be distributed through our network. The final part of this thesis will recommend a business model based on the outcomes of the first two parts of this thesis.This thesis project should be useful for the fourth thesis project that must create an appropriate business plan and this thesis should also help the technical developer by providing market analysis that can be used to guide technical decisions.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91045\", \"number-of-pages\": \"49\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"199\", \"keyword\": \"commercialization plan; e-book; publishing\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-07T08:40:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-06T16:11:55.106+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:31:55.968+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91045\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 49.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:536329\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1995]]}, \"title\": \"The mobitex network in the point of sale application\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Dabbous\", \"given\": \"Fouad\", \"localId\": \"u1ntuctv\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Ismailov\", \"given\": \"Yuri\", \"localId\": \"u1qe4n19\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The Purpose of the work is to provide a solution for interfacing the point-of-sale terminal (POST) with Mobitex radio modem (mobidem) on the mobile side and a solution for interfacing the authorization center host computer with the Mobitex area exchanges (MOX), at the fixed side.

After that the client simply waits until the object is printed, with all of the various steps being handled automatically.The uploaded file containing the 3D design is automatically converted into Gcode by using the software Skeinforge. Gocde is the language that the printer interprets. The printer itself is controlled by the ReplicatorG program. The ReplicatorG program transfers the Gcode commands to the printer to print the desired object.

In the beginning achieving wide area coverage was a great achievement \\u2013 enabling subscribers to call from wherever they were currently located and whenever they wanted. Additionally these systems supported mobility of subscribers, so that calls could continue even while a subscriber moved from one cell to another. Today mobility management is something everyone takes for granted. New functionality is continuously being developed for these networks. An important aspect of this evolution has been to enable new applications and technologies to be introduced while maintaining interoperability with the existing technologies.These mobile networks use new technologies and enable new applications, but they interconnect with existing networks that utilize earlier technologies, such as the existing fixed telephone network. These interconnections enable communication between subscribers connected via all of these networks. In today\\u2019s mobile networks there are a variety of technologies working side by side, for example 2G, GPRS, 3G, and so on. The earlier networks used circuit switching technology, but the trend in later networks was to transition exclusively to packet switching.One of the most important network entities is the mobile switch center (MSC). In the earlier circuit switched networks the MSC is the heart of the circuit switching network. The MSC is responsible for management, control, and communication to and from the mobile stations (MSs) in the area managed by the MSC. The MSC stores information about each of the MSs in one or more databases. In the subscriber\\u2019s home network the information about their subscription is stored in a home location register (HLR), while when this subscriber is in another network information is stored in a visitor location register (VLR). The MSC together with other elements of the core network handles mobility management, enabling both handover and roaming. A gateway MSC enables MSs to communicate with phones connected to the fixed network.The aim of this thesis is to analyze the traffic situation for Kulyab region in order to configure and install the MSC in Kulyab. For the time being there is no radio network controller (RNC) in Kulyab region, so the MSC in Kulyab will be configured to support 2G traffic.The configuration will be based on the expected mobile traffic load in the Kulyab region, thus the first steps in the process were to collect and analyze data about the existing traffic in this region that is currently served by a MSC located outside of this region. The configuration of the new MSC will be based on this analysis.After installing and configuring the new MSC some question need to be answered, namely:<ol><li>Can the MSC in Kulyab support all the base stations in Kulyab region? If not, how many base stations can it support?</li><li>To what extent does the addition of this new MSC improve the overall network in terms of increased reliability, capacity, and throughput?</li><li>How much will the capacity of the existing MSC, that is responsible for traffic outside Dushanbe, be increased due to the introduction of the new MSC?</li></ol>\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91095\", \"number-of-pages\": \"190\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2011:140\", \"keyword\": \"MSC; MSC server; MGW; BHCA traffic load; connect traffic load; 2G; mobile traffic; mobile network\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-08T09:45:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-07T15:06:55.326+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:30:41.236+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91095\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 190.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:527840\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"Traffic Prioritization Subject to Cost\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Ekstrand\", \"given\": \"Magnus\", \"localId\": \"u11peqs3\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Hubaux\", \"given\": \"Jean-Pierre\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"EPFL, Laussanne, Switzerland\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Martin-Flatin\", \"given\": \"Jean-Philippe\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"EPFL, Laussanne, Switzerland\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Biro\", \"given\": \"Georges\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"SA Adventis Communications Engineering\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"In order to carry real-time traffic like video, IP networks -- especially intranets -- recently began to deal with different levels of priority for communication flows.

The wireless networks of today are limited in range or in bandwidth. In this thesis work DVB-T (Digital Video Broadcast - Terrestrial) has been studied in combination with GSM (Global System for Mobile communications), in order to evaluate how such a system can be used to provide a high bandwidth, long range, data link.\\nThe commonly used Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is known to perform very poorly with asymmetric and long delay links. Wireless links usually have bit errors, errors that corrupts packets, and often these bit errors come in bursts and thereby corrupting many packets. More than one lost packet will significantly degrade the TCP performance. In an asymmetric network the link with the smallest bandwidth will set the limit of throughput if any kind of data acknowledgments (Acks) are used. TCP is ACK driven and for large asymmetries the theoretical throughput will depend heavily on the packet-size and the bandwidth of the narrow link. The DVB-T/GSM system is both wireless and highly asymmetric, in raw bandwidth as well as in delay, which makes the use of standard TCP unworkable.\\nMany techniques has been studied in order to find a solution to how the transport protocol should be tuned to handle the characteristics of DVB-T and GSM. The solution presented in this work does not set any demands on the host on the Internet, and is fully compatible with existing standards.

With Software Defined Networking (SDN), a central controller can configure these virtual switches. Virtual switches execute on commodity operating systems. Open vSwitch is an open source project that is widely used in production cloud environments. If an adversary gains access with full privileges to the operating system hosting the virtual switch, then Open vSwitch becomes vulnerable to a variety of different attacks that could compromise the whole network.The purpose of this thesis project is to improve the security of Open vSwitch implementations in order to ensure that only authenticated switches and controllers can communicate with each other, while maintaining code integrity and confidentiality of keys and certificates. The thesis project proposes a design and shows an implementation that leverages Intel\\u00ae Safe Guard Extensions (SGX) technology. A new library, TLSonSGX, is implemented. This library replaces the use of the OpenSSL library in Open vSwitch. In addition to implementing standard Transport Level Security (TLS) connectivity, TLSonSGX confines TLS communication in the protected memory enclave and hence protects TLS sensitive components necessary to provide confidentiality and integrity, such as private keys and negotiated symmetric keys. Moreover, TLSonSGX introduces new, secure, and automatic means to generate keys and obtain signed certificates from a central Certificate Authority that validates using Linux Integrity Measurements Architecture (IMA) that the Open vSwitch binaries have not been tampered with before issuing a signed certificate. The generated keys and obtained certificates are stored in the memory enclave and hence never exposed as plaintext outside the enclave. This new mechanism is a replacement for the existing manual and unsecure procedures (as described in Open vSwitch project).A security analysis of the system is provided as well as an examination of performance impact of the use of a trusted execution environment. Results show that generating keys and certificates using TLSonSGX takes less than 0.5 seconds while adding 30% latency overhead for the first packet in a flow compared to using OpenSSL when both are executed on Intel\\u00ae CoreTM i7-6600U processor clocked at 2.6 GHz. These results show that TLSonSGX can enhance Open vSwitch security and reduce its TLS configuration overhead.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-218070\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiv,64\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2017:195\", \"keyword\": \"Open vSwitch; SDN; Trusted Execution Environment; SGX; Cloud Computing; Open vSwitch; SDN; mjukvarudefinierade n\\u00e4tverk; SGX; molntj\\u00e4nster\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-12-10T14:43:55.947+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-11-22T15:04:33.835+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T23:17:41.146+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-218070\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 78.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1615039\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2021]]}, \"title\": \"Tuning the Canvas Docker Ecosystem : Tuning and optimization suggestions\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Wu\", \"given\": \"Nan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879223\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r elektroteknik och datavetenskap (EECS)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": []}], \"abstract\": \"Canvas is a LMS used by many colleges, universities, and K-12 schools.

However, small flight computers must have sufficientenvironmental knowledge and computational capabilities to provide real-timecontrol to function without a ground station connection. Using a Raspberry Pi4 model B, this thesis presents a practical implementation for evaluating pathplanning generators in the context of following a moving target. The practicalmodel integrates two waypoint generators for the path planning scenario: A*and 3D Vector Field Histogram* (3DVFH*). The performances of the pathplanning algorithms are evaluated in terms of the required processing time,distance from the target, and memory consumption. The simulations are runin two types of environments. One is modelled by hand with a target walkinga scripted path. The other is procedurally generated with a random walker.The study shows that 3DVFH* produces paths that follow the moving targetmore closely when the actor follows the scripted path. With a random walker,A* consistently achieves the shortest distance. Furthermore, the practicalimplementation shows that the A* algorithm\\u2019s persistent approach to detectand track objects has a prohibitive memory requirement that the Raspberry Pi4 with a 2GBRAMcannot handle. Looking at the impact of object density, the3DVFH* implementation shows no impact on distance to the moving target,but exhibits lower execution speeds at an altitude with fewer obstacles to detect.The A* implementation has a marked impact on execution speeds in the formof longer distances to the target at altitudes with dense obstacle detection.This research project also realized a communication link between thepath planning implementations and a Geographical Information System (GIS)application supported by the Carmenta Engine SDK to explore how locallystored geospatial information impact path planning scenarios.

These types of applications are referred to as massive IoT, as opposed to critical IoT, which emphasizes ultra-high reliability and availability and low latency. One type of network catering to massive IoT applications are Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs), and presently, many LPWAN standards are trying to assert their role in the IoT ecosystem.This thesis explores LPWANs from both technical and non-technical perspectives to ascertain their use-case versatility and influence on the future telecommunications\\u2019 landscape. With respect to spectrum, the studied LPWANs may be categorized as unlicensed LPWAN or licensed LPWAN. The prior category typically refers to proprietary solutions and in this thesis are represented by SigFox and LoRaWAN. The latter group includes EC-GSM-IoT, eMTC, and NB-IoT and can be considered synonymous with cellular LPWAN because they are designed to be integrated into existing cellular infrastructures.The results indicate that all of the different types of explored LPWANs support applications without strict downlink, payload size, and latency requirements. For use cases without these specific demands (typically sensors, meters, tracking, etc.), it is not a question of whether or not a network fulfills the requirements, but rather how flexible the requirements are. As a result the choice of network will be determined by non-technical aspects and a cost versus functionality trade-off where unlicensed LPWAN is typically cheaper. Hence, both categories of LPWANs offer a unique value proposition; therefore, they can be considered complementary. This notion is reinforced when looking at non-technical aspects such as ecosystem, regulation, network ownership and control, and network coordination, which differ quite significantly. Furthermore, unlicensed LPWANs are likely to be the vanguard of a new type of competitor offering the core service of connectivity.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-214941\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xvi,114\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2017:123\", \"keyword\": \"LPWA; LPWAN; IoT; massive IoT; NB-IoT; eMTC; EC-GSM-IoT; SigFox; LoRa; LoRaWAN; LoRa Alliance\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-10-13T09:17:16.962+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-09-25T21:37:43.999+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-27T00:06:56.327+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-214941\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 130.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:516952\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2000]]}, \"title\": \"Usability Evaluation of Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Nowbakht\", \"given\": \"Ali\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The present study is the result of a master's thesis project at Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm-Sweden.

However, we encountered some difficulties performing these experiments, which could be explained by the characteristics of the network (production network), used during the tests.\\nOur next step was to apply this theory to a high capacity network. The result of these experiments confirms that a reservation could statistically get through in the end-hosts and the routers. To our disappointment we found that loading the network with high capacity of flow results in failure to meet requirements of the reservation.\\nI believe that RSVP may be used \\\"as is\\\" for small and well-controlled environments.

The MUST is divided into five different phases that form a lifecycle, describing the workflow when conducting usability engineering: Know the User, Setting Goals, Prototyping, Testing and User Feedback.

There are two common wireless Internet access solutions: wireless local area network (WLAN) via hotspot, and high speed wide area cellular network via mobile broadband device such as 3G/4G Universal Serial Bus (USB) dongle. USB dongle was the pioneer product in 3G/4G market, and it is still a popular device in many countries. Mobile broadband can offer both high speed access and mobility. Technically mobile broadband allows Internet connection as long as your mobile transceiver can access your cellular network operator\\u2019s network. However, in practice the data rates experienced by a user via mobile broadband are not comparable to the data rates that are available via WLAN. Moreover, mobile broadband has been implemented according to multiple different standards. Hence, in order to provide a user with locally optimal service requires that user must make use of heterogeneous networks. Furthermore, the variety of networks gets increasing due to the emergence of various 4G networks.The aim of this thesis is to explore how heterogeneous networks could be exploited to provide a user of a laptop computer with locally optimal service, while hiding the complexity of this heterogeneous service. The research focuses on the implications of integrating multiple network interfaces into a single USB dongle. Our research shows that multi-mode USB dongle is still needed in market, though there are competitions from smartphones and mobile WiFi devices. We point out that the PPP (Point to Point Protocol) based USB dongle should update to Ethernet USB protocols such as RNDIS (Remote Network Driver Interface Specification) or USB CDC (Communications Device Class) protocols. Furthermore, we suggest a USB dongle should be able to work as a WLAN access point to share Internet with other mobile devices, and it should also work as a WLAN client which can join other hotspots. If hotspot operators can authenticate USB dongles by SIM cards, then users can easily access a great number of hotspots belong to these operators.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-169898\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiv,57\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2015:144\", \"keyword\": \"Data communications; USB; WLAN; 3G; 4G; Datakommunication; USB; WLAN; 3G; 4G\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-06-25T15:41:39.641+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-06-24T13:20:44.586+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T13:31:57.138+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-169898\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 71.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:541143\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1997]]}, \"title\": \"User Centered Communicating Devices\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Falk Drugge\", \"given\": \"Anna Elisabet\", \"localId\": \"u1b6ah5l\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The extensive use of communicating computers in the future will require the development of products and services that are easy to use.

More and more communication techniques are based on packet-switched technology instead of the circuit-switched ones. At the same time as these technologies become available to the market new kind of services are evolving, e.g. wireless monitoring of vehicles.\\nServices like wireless monitoring of vehicles have been available on the market for more than a decade. Especially in Europe they are built upon circuit-switched technologies or message services with low transmission rates. Though with the upcoming packet-switched technologies the customers and service providers will get access to new types of capabilities regarding quality of service, billing, and transmission rates. To build these services new types of high availability service platforms are needed. There will be a strong requirement for scalability, fault tolerance, redundancy, and distribution. Additionally there\\u2019ll be a demand that the platform support hot upgrades, i.e. dynamic software upgrade during execution. These requirements are very common in telecommunications environments.\\nIn the report different wireless communication technologies are evaluated and the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is chosen as the means of communication. The reason is that it is a packet-switched technology, the transmission rate is rather high, it supports Internet Protocol (IP) data, and it\\u2019s the first step in the evolution path towards the third generation (3G) wireless communication systems. Services based on GPRS can also be used in the future 3G networks without modifications.\\nDifferent high availability platforms were also evaluated regarding the requirements placed on future service platforms. The conclusion is that more and more of these platforms will move from a hardware centric approach to a more software-based architecture. Of the platforms evaluated, the conclusion is that Ronja is the platform most suited for the task.\\nFuture services, e.g. wireless monitoring of vehicles, can benefit from using Ronja and GPRS. The time and money saved by using the high availability functionality provided by the Ronja platform are significant. To use GPRS as the communication media may also reduce the costs for the customers that use these kinds of services.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93288\", \"number-of-pages\": \"61\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-18T14:03:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-13T13:21:44.251+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:55:10.477+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93288\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 61.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:517624\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"Using GSM Short Message Service for Internet Applications\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Spens Clasons\", \"given\": \"Sam\", \"localId\": \"u10wm2io\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The purpose of this report is to show that the mobile Internet to some extent can be made to happen today by integrating existing GSM and Internet infrastructures while adding a little intelligence.

People find it convenient to be able to check for incoming emails without being required to be at a fixed location. High-end mobile phones with high resolution color screens and mail clients (or plug-ins) much like the classic clients that run on desktop and laptop computers, have made mail manipulation on a mobile phone both easy and interesting. However, one key difference is the phone\\u2019s battery power source. Where power was not an issue for desktop and even many laptop computers, since they are almost all the time connected to an AC supply or have high capacity battery storage, it is a major issue for mobile phones. While email applications have greatly advanced, there has not been much improvement in mobile battery capacity. In addition the battery lifetime has decreased due to the high power demands of multimedia applications, which may be running almost constantly.\\nTraditionally, a mail client checks for new email messages by polling the mail server. This works well with computers attached to the power mains or with a large capacity battery, but for mobile phones, polling causes significant battery drain. A solution would be to poll the server less frequently by increasing the polling interval, however this would delay email reception hence increasing latency.\\nIn this thesis we implement and evaluate a new mail delivery system without changing the underlying mail or communications infrastructure. The new system eliminates the need for polling by using network initiated mail delivery. This means that a mail server will forward mail directly to a particular user. Tests conducted with a prototype are compared to the use of the existing system in terms of power consumption and latency. These tests show that the new mail delivery system reduces both power consumption and delivery delay.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92016\", \"number-of-pages\": \"60\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2007-11\", \"keyword\": \"Last Hop SMTP\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-26T11:07:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T16:23:18.243+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:14:25.533+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92016\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 60.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:827016\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2015]]}, \"title\": \"Using Six Sigma Methodology to improve the performance of the Shipment Test\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Bin\", \"given\": \"Yang\", \"localId\": \"u10thvdi\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Rutkowska\", \"given\": \"Bogumila\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Competition and lead-time pressure motivates us to find new and better ways of continuously improving the output of our work.

One of the essential principles of shipment testing is to ensure that the test campaigns finish on time. Over the last several decades companies have spent large amounts of time and money on improving test quality and efficiency. Unfortunately, the results have not always been as good as expected. It seems that it is very difficult to improve shipment testing performance using traditional test management methods.Motorola introduced Six Sigma in 1986 and achieved 5.4 Sigma level which help them saved 2.2 Billion dollars during the first six years. From Statistic aspect, it means only 3.4 defects per million opportunities. The Six Sigma methodology has been applied as a management philosophy focused on improving efficiency and performance during the shipment test period.This thesis gives an introduction to the Six Sigma approach, including the concepts of Six Sigma, its history, development, and methodology.

This thesis describes how new services that only utilise spare capacity should be provided. Models and evaluations of the available capacity for packet switched mobile telephony networks such as GPRS and UMTS are presented. The capacity during daytime is limited and fluctuates considerably.\\nThe introduction of several quality of service levels is strongly advocated in order to protect sensitive applications and to provide cheap background service classes. In order to provide the background class with a low price the quality of service level has to be low in order to avoid disturbing the market potential for other service classes.\\nThe cheap background class would make room for new applications that require substantial transmission capacity but can accept long delays. These applications should not require user interaction. Examples of such applications are push services such as music, news and software distribution.\\nThe transmission costs for push services that only utilise spare capacity should be very low ideally independent of the amount of data sent. It is very important that the network operators have a flat-rate background class. To maximise the utilisation of the spare capacity it is very important to have substantial storage capacity in the mobile devices. Since the transmission cost should be flat-rated, the memory in the mobile devices will always be filled. A substantial increase in storage capacity will therefore allow new services to emerge.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93730\", \"number-of-pages\": \"65\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": \"GPRS; UMTS; quality of service; QoS; background services\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-20T14:18:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-24T16:26:41.329+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:46:58.092+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93730\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 65.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:515034\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2003]]}, \"title\": \"Value Added Services and Content Platforms\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Mahdavi\", \"given\": \"Adrian\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Pigall\", \"given\": \"Alexander\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Tele2 AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Value-Added Services and Content Platforms (VAS and Content platforms) was carried out with in a group with same name at Tele2 AB in Kista, Stockholm.

Acceptance testing is performed on new devices (servers and other network components) in order to verify their capacity and performance guaranteed by their manufactures. Every platform has a guaranteed upper bound performance (based on the license a buyer has paid for), measured by different approaches.

Since an SLA very often specifies a contract between a service provider and customer, I found it necessary to approach the QoS concept from an end-to-end perspective. Not only figuring out how QoS is meant to work in a separate LAN, but how you actually provide a verifiable level of service end-to-end across multiple networks. To be able to come up with viable solutions and ideas to solve this task I divided my work into several phases.\\nFirst I built up a working knowledge about IP networks, how they function and interact to form larger networks, secondly I needed to understand the vast QoS area, what technologies and standards are in place today and how they work together to form IP networks with support for differentiated traffic.\\nFinally I needed to understand how to monitor and supervise IP networks on both small and larger scales, to see what techniques and methods are used to provide network administrators with sufficient information about the traffic in the network.\\nThe first part of my thesis work provides information on these subjects giving a thorough understanding of all the different technologies.\\nThe second part describes different solutions to the problem of monitoring QoS enabled IP networks. The problem really has many sides to it. Not only did I need to find out what to monitor, I also needed to find out how to monitor it. Generally SLAs are pretty simple, containing parameters such as uptime, maximum packet loss allowed and so on. These parameters are relatively easy to monitor. A QoS SLA is by its very nature more complex, both regarding parameters to monitor and in terms of responsibility placed on the customer. Depending on the nature of the agreement between customer and ISP, a QoS SLA could fit on a single sheet of paper or maybe 10 sheets. It all depends on the level of service complexity needing to be specified.\\nIn view of the above and as a result of my work I have come up with a solution of how to monitor a DiffServ compliant network. This monitoring provides information suitable for the verification of SLAs. It enables monitoring of bandwidth, packet loss, delay and jitter for traffic.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93539\", \"number-of-pages\": \"98\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-20T11:01:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-20T12:35:25.601+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:50:23.477+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93539\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 98.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1129877\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2017]]}, \"title\": \"Video Integrity through Blockchain Technology\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Hemlin Billstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Adam\", \"localId\": \"u18m2arw\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Huss\", \"given\": \"Fabian\", \"localId\": \"u17k0dsc\", \"affiliation\": []}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Wilmot\", \"given\": \"Ben\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The increasing capabilities of today\\u2019s smartphones enables users to live stream video directly from their mobile device.

Blockchain is a technology with the inherent ability to store data in a chronological chained link of events: establishing an irrefutable database. Using cryptographic hashes together with blockchain: an Android device can generate cryptographic hashes of the data content from a video recording, and consequently transmit these hashes to a blockchain. The same video is deconstructed in the web client creating hashes that can subsequently be compared with the ones found in the blockchain.A resulting prototype system provides some of the desired functions. However, the prototype is limited in that it does not have the ability to sign the hashes produced. It has also been limited in that it does not employ HTTPS for communication, and the verification process needs to be optimized to make it usable for real applications.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-211532\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xv,77\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2017:122\", \"keyword\": \"Hashing; live stream; video integrity; video verification; blockchain; hash; direks\\u00e4ndning; videointegritet; videoverifiering; blockkedja\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-10-13T09:07:45.145+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-08-07T15:19:15.163+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-27T00:48:13.002+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-211532\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 92.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:516849\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2000]]}, \"title\": \"Virtual community networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Lind\", \"given\": \"Mikael\", \"localId\": \"u1g1ncx9\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Engman\", \"given\": \"Alexander\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Telia Research AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"As the use of broadband Internet connections increases a need for new services arises.

It is possible to enable full IPconnectivity in the cellular networks. However this connectivity is combined with a lot of issues such as security problems and the IPv4 address space being depleted. As a result of this many operators use Network Address Translation in their packet data networks, preventing users in different networks from being able to contact each other. Even if a transition to IPv6 takes place and the potential problem of address space is solved, it is not likely that operators will leave their packet data networks open to the Internet.\\nAn alternative to solving the problem on the IP level is to use overlay networks. In an overlay network applications on the cellular devices identify themselves at the application level rather than on the IP level. While full IP connectivity always gives the most efficient routing, an overlay network can offer services that are difficult to implement on the IP level. This can enable an application to <i><b>span Network Address Translating entities</b></i> without having to share the entire device. They can also provide private dynamic virtual networks and groups for users that trust each other. These <i><b>private networks</b></i> can use permissions and <i><b>group casting</b> </i>functions, without the problems associated with traditional IP multicast.\\nThe relatively limited bandwidths of the GSM and UMTS networks allow for application level routing of continuous data streams <i><b>if</b></i> the overlay network is <i><b>distributed</b></i> enough and mapped to the physical network in an efficient way. One of the advantages of using overlay networks is that although standard IP networks may be able to offer similar services in the future, overlay networks can be implemented in the existing IPv4 networks today at comparatively low costs. This may create the incentive needed in order for future larger investments to be justified.\\nA distributed overlay network not only allows for<i><b> real-time services</b></i> such as instant messaging, which is already possible with a centralized server solution, but it also allows for <i><b>higher bandwidth services</b></i> such as video conferencing, Voice over IP, etc. that are not possible on a large scale with a centralized relaying server.\\nAn overlay network could be implemented by any third party <i><b>without the support of an operator</b></i>. This suggests that free networks may be created for what could be called <i><b>reversed file sharing</b></i>, i.e. networks where users upload files to each other rather than download as in most existing file sharing networks. These could become direct <i><b>competitors to SMS, MMS</b></i> and other operator-owned services.\\nThe thesis investigates the mentioned possibilities and potential threats.

In this project, an automated detection system is used to detect sows in surveillance videos. This system is based upon deep learning and computer vision methods. In order to minimize disk storage and to meet the network requirements necessary to achieve the real-performance, tracking in compressed video streams is essential.The proposed system uses a Discriminative Correlation Filter (DCF) as a classifier to detect targets. The tracking model is updated by training the classifier with online learning methods. Compression technology encodes the video data, thus reducing both the bit rates at which video signals are transmitted and helping the video transmission better adapt to the limited network bandwidth. However, compression may reduce the image quality of the videos the precision of our tracking may decrease. Hence, we conducted a performance evaluation of existing visual tracking algorithms on video sequences with quality degradation due to various compression parameters (encoders, target bitrate, rate control model, and Group of Pictures (GOP) size). The ultimate goal of video compression is to realize a tracking system with equal performance, but requiring fewer network resources.The proposed tracking algorithm successfully tracks each sow in consecutive frames in most cases. The performance of our tracker was benchmarked against two state-of-art tracking algorithms: Siamese Fully-Convolutional (FC) and Efficient Convolution Operators (ECO). The performance evaluation result shows our proposed tracker has similar performance to both Siamese FC and ECO.In comparison with the original tracker, the proposed tracker achieved similar tracking performance, while requiring much less storage and generating a lower bitrate when the video was compressed with appropriate parameters. However, the system is far slower than needed for real-time tracking due to high computational complexity; therefore, more optimal methods to update the tracking model will be needed to achieve real-time tracking.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-240086\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xv,93\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2018:753\", \"keyword\": \"Computer vision; Video tracking; Machine learning; Discriminative correlation filter; Compressed video; Bandwidth balancing; Network traffic; Dator vision; Video sp\\u00e5rning; Maskininl\\u00e4rning; Diskriminerande korrelationsfilter; Komprimerad video; Bandbredd balansering; N\\u00e4tverkstrafik\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-12-11T13:42:14.442+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-12-11T12:57:36.221+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T18:09:11.644+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-240086\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 108.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:541153\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"Voice over IP - SIP client\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Filimonovic\", \"given\": \"Martin\", \"localId\": \"u17u9md7\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Lindberg\", \"given\": \"Niclas\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Radio Systems\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The interest in utilizing the Internet for real-time communication has grown substantially in recent years.

It plays a vital role to ensure national security and to control crimes by providing authorized monitoring of communicating parties in a communication network. However, there are some important issues that need to be addressed, such as the privacy of individuals, malicious use of lawful interception by a \\u201cbad\\u201d cop, vulnerability of a lawful interception system to misuse by others, cost, legal liability, etc. These issues have lead to opposition to lawful interception. Many researchers have been looking for a secure and acceptable lawful interception system that would eliminate or minimize the undesirable aspects of lawful interception. One of the approaches that gained a lot of attention is a key escrow encryption system. For lawful interception a key recovery key is escrowed with a trusted third party. This key can subsequently be used for decryption by the law enforcement agency. The trusted third party might be a government agency or a private company. The process for recovering keys should be based on a predefined securitypolicy. The trusted third party\\u2019s responsibility is to store the key and to protect it from malicious use. This malicious use\\u00a0could be by a competitor, a telecommunication operator, Internet Service Provider (ISP), a law enforcement agency, or other party. If the trusted third party itself utilizes the key or improperly discloses the key to another party, then the data that was protected by encryption could be compromised Unfortunately, there is no easy means to detect if the data has been tampered with or not. This thesis focuses on therefore in the case of voice over IP, where there is a need for a means to determine if a recorded conversation is authentic or not. Hence the objective of the overall thesis project is to design, implement, and evaluate a security mechanism that can be used with a trusted third party -based key escrow encryption system that will prevent or reduce the risk of forgery by (a bad cop within) a lawenforcement agency using the escrowed key.\\nThis thesis describes how a key escrow encryption system would be improved by the proposed mechanism \\u2013 with a focus on the actions of a party that has access to the escrowed key. We do not examine how the party got access to this key, but for the purposes of this thesis we assumed that this party is either a good cop or a bad cop. We have defined the meaning of these terms and examine what operations a bad cop might attempt to perform \\u2013 given the access to the master key. For example, this party could capture the data packets of a Voice over IP session, and then decrypt the packets using the key provided by the escrow agent. After decryption we examined the ability of a bad cop to modify or forge data packets, then encrypt these forged packets with the key \\u2013 in order to fabricate evidence. We then examined how to detect such modifications or forgery. The proposed system is able to detect this forgery, based upon the inability of the forger to generate the correctly signed hashed message authentication coded. We also examine additional extensions to the user agent and the escrow agent to be able to identify which packets (or groups of packets) were not generated by the original participant in the conversation. The goal is to understand if the proposed mechanism could make lawful interception more secure, while increasing the protection of the communicating parties\\u2019 conversation from undetected manipulation and making the digital record of a conversion easier to authenticate.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-24260\", \"number-of-pages\": \"164\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2010-08-31T10:04:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2010-08-31T08:40:22.866+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-25T01:56:44.730+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-24260\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 164.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511505\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2008]]}, \"title\": \"Voice Over IP for Textphones : An implementation of an Analog Telephone Adapter enabling Baudot textphones to use real-time text over Real-time Transport Protocol using open-source code and hardware solutions\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"H\\u00f6rlin\", \"given\": \"Martin\", \"localId\": \"u10j35po\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Zetterstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Erik\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Omnitor AB\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Hellstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Gunnar\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Omnitor AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"In this thesis we will discuss how to implement a ToIP device that enables communication with a standard textphone over Internet Protocol using open software and hardware solutions.

To address security related issues Wi-Fi Alliance in conjunction with IEEE introduced an enhanced and interoperable security scheme called WiFi Protected Access (WPA).\\nReal time services are sensitive to latency, hence requiring bounded delay time throughout an ongoing session. Handovers in WiFi networks can take fairly long time which real time services cannot tolerate. The problem is further elevated when WiFi networks are secured by using WPA Enterprise.\\nIn this thesis we will examine the complete handoff process in WiFi networks.

In fact, software revenue is now a large part of the total revenue. As technology has developed and traffic demands increase, more and more functions required to implement the radio system are implemented via software rather than hardware. Today, many hardware functions are actually implemented with reconfigurable and programmable hardware. Therefore, it is often possible to perform an upgrade by loading new software (a software upgrade) rather than needing to change the physical hardware with every technology advance. However, introducing new elements and features in existing (often mature) software may cause unexpected problems. These problems may include new parts malfunctioning and failure or degradation of old functions. To avoid these problems, each version of software has to be thoroughly tested, not only to test the new parts, but also to verify that the old functions still work properly. Testing all the old functions is time and human resource consuming. Thus, there is an increasing demand for automated testing.

Moreover, the available bandwidth turned out to be an important factor, which should be added as an additional stats-parameter to improve the performance of a WebRTC quality control service.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-232704\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xii,74\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2018:465\", \"keyword\": \"WebRTC communication system; QoS assessment; Quality control; Data Analysis; Modeling; WebRTC-kommunikationssystem; QoS-bed\\u00f6mning; Kvalitetskontroll; Dataanalys; Modellering\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-11-19T09:16:45.192+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-07-30T16:10:42.855+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T19:58:44.656+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-232704\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 86.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:527039\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"Wireless Adaptation of a Security Management Protocol Suite\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Carrara\", \"given\": \"Elisabetta\", \"localId\": \"u167oevx\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Davoli\", \"given\": \"Franco\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Universit\\u00e0 degli studi di Genova, Dipartimento di Informatica, Sistemistica e Telematica\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Internet Security is rapidly increasing in importance, as Internet itself is spreading out so fast.

A general overview of cryptography is also provided, since ISAKMP widely uses modern cryptographic techniques.\\nISAKMP flexibility is at the cost of complexity and increased packet traffic. This should be faced in constrained communications, such as wireless. Therefore, this thesis introduces some proposals for a compressed version of the protocol, trying to reduce the number of handshakes and the number of transmitted bytes without significantly decreasing the security level.\\nThe model is based on the use of a Proxy, which follows the compressed version of ISAKMP on the side of the\\u00a0 mobile node, and then switches to the original version of the protocol on the wired side with the second peer.

It also shows how applications are created and how they operate in different parts of the network. The report covers security issues and services charging, as well as how other technologies could be used together with the Wireless Application Protocol, or how they could replace parts of it. The second part of the report covers the application I have created as part of my project. The application is divided up in order to show different aspects of the Wireless Application Protocol. The emphasis in the project has been on real-time graphic generation, which is exemplified in a vector based map application. The possibilities to connect Wireless Application Protocol applications to databases and peripherals are then explored.\\nIn conclusion, the fundamental idea of using the Internet as part of the network structure is appealing, both for users and services providers. There are, however, parts of the Wireless Application Protocol that are not realised in the best possible way. There are security weaknesses due to protocol conversions in the middle of the network.

Verification is done at runtime against a reference program execution trace produced by the transpiler by means of symbolic execution in the operational semantics of \\u03bcSPL.

The problem is high delays implying low utilization of allocated resources for small file transfers or due to packet losses. High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA)\\u2019s potential to solve the problem is studied. Since in HSDPA, High-Speed Downlink shared channel (HS-DSCH) is introduced as an alternative of DCH on downlink packet access, a model of HS-DSCH is built and simulations are performed in order to compare its TCP performance with DCH. The focus is on studying retransmission delay and Block Error Rate (BLER) targets. Some scheduling methods are also compared. The results indicate that HS-DSCH gives better TCP performance than a DCH, and that advanced scheduling methods gives similar result as round robin if there are packet losses. Moreover, a somewhat surprising result is found regarding fast retransmission and channel utilization for increasing BLER targets.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93068\", \"number-of-pages\": \"46\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-IMIT-LCN.

The third generation of mobile communication systems (3G) will be a significant step forward in the convergence of telecommunications and datacommunications industries. More specifically, the convergence of mobile technologies and the Internet allows compelling possibilities for future applications and solutions. However, most current mobile businesses and mobile application and solution providers are rather contributing to the process of convergence; many current ideas and solutions are based on the restrictions of existing mobile networks combined with Internet-based services. In the future, when mobile networks and the Internet have merged, it will no longer be possible to create revenue with these types of solutions.\\nOne concrete solution is the mobile middleware concept, bridging the mobile technologies and Internet world. This Master\\u2019s thesis studies the middleware concept for providing business applications in the light of 3G, making strategic recommendations to a provider of these kinds of services. A comprehensive discussion about the developments after 3G is introduced. Alternative solutions are presented and some strategic implications are introduced. The implications are motivated by an industry survey, carried out within this project. The topic of over-the-air data synchronization is discussed as an example for interim middleware. Mobile computing file system issues are seen as an interesting opportunity for business applications. The possibility of remote desktop screen access is studied, and measurements proving its feasability for hosted wireless application service provision are made. Emerging mobile Java technologies are discussed as an efficient platform for providing ubiquitous, device independent end-to-end solutions. As one of the recommended strategies, this thesis introduces the concept of hybrid thickness client applications as a feasible solution for migrating from current middleware solutions to an (uncertain) future of native, thick terminal applications, within a scope of two years. Based on this concept, a prototype for a 3G smartphone application was developed as an example. A set of possible strategic scenarios is presented and discussed. This thesis also discusses operator differentiation and business solutions in an all-IP based world.\\n3G networks and handset devices will introduce a large number of new applications and business opportunities, but such a change will also introduce new challenges and risks. The migration challenge is being illustrated in the case of Smartner, a mobile middleware solution provider focusing on business applications. As shown by this case, compared to current enabling solutions, a major shift in technologies is seen as needed, in order to maintain long-term success.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93278\", \"number-of-pages\": \"183\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": \"3G; mobile business; middleware; front-end; operator-hosted; strategy; convergence; migration; XML; hybrid thickness client application; SyncML; Wireless OS; UMTS; GPRS; EPOC; Symbian; value added services; operator differentiation; competitive advantage\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-13T15:26:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-13T11:03:18.430+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:55:28.075+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93278\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 183.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:515331\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2003]]}, \"title\": \"A comparative study of two different network basedIP Virtual Private Network solutions\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Holmlund\", \"given\": \"Erik\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Lopez\", \"given\": \"Edgar\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Skanova, Telia\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Network based (layer 3) IP VPNs is a growing service and Skanova has a solution today which has received a lot of customer attention. The service is called VPN Flex and offers the customers secure communication between their different offices while supporting different traffic classes with a guaranteed maximum delay, jitter, and packet loss. VPN Flex has been a success so far in terms of the number of customers that have signed up for it in the short time it has been on the market. VPN Flex is realized over an IP network on Skanova's ATM backbone.\\nMeanwhile Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) has attracted a lot of attention and is considered to have a lot of nice features; the most import being the ability to provide layer 2 and layer 3 IP VPNs. The MPLS solution for providing network based layer 3 IP VPNs is described in RFC 2547, also called BGP/MPLS VPNs. It has become the de-facto standard for providing network based layer 3 IP VPNs. Skanova's VPN Flex service is provided by a partly Nortel proprietary solution using IP tunneling instead of MPLS tunneling which is used in RFC 2547.\\nThe purpose of this paper is to evaluate which network (i.e. link layer technology; specifically a frame based or a cell based media) and which network based IP VPN solution is most suitable to provide a network based layer 3 IP VPN service that supports different traffic classes so that Skanova's customers can use this VPN service to send best effort traffic, mission critical applications, IP Telephony, and Video Conferencing services between their different offices using a single layer 3 VPN solution.\\nIn my evaluation I have looked at the technology behind the VPN solution, the ability to provide delay, jitter, and packet loss guarantees as well as what it costs to produce the service along with the security and expected reliability. The purpose of having a master\\u2019s thesis student looking at this problem is that I would be objective and not have any predetermined conclusions.\\nThe result of the study is that the two different network based VPN solutions are not different with regard to the service they provide for the customers. However, there are some differences that affect the operator deploying and running the service. RFC 2547 is a more flexible solution with less manual configuration and better support for Inter-AS VPNs. It is possible to realize an RFC 2547 solution in either an ATM network or an IP network and the services will be implemented in much the same way. Both solutions could use Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) signaling and EXP Inferred PHB Scheduling Class LSPs (ELSPs), realizing traffic classes using the MPLS EXP bits. Which network to base the solution on, is a matter of QoS support, costs, and security. The ATM network today has better QoS support (such as more transmission queues and efficient schedulers). However, at the link speeds used in today\\u2019s backbones the fixed size cell of ATM is not a reason to use the ATM network instead of a frame based IP network.\\nThe cost of using Packet Over Sonet (POS) and ATM is the same. However, using Ethernet the port cost is less than half of either POS or ATM, which favors using an IP network in the A comparative study of two different network based IP Virtual Private Network solutions future. The security of a network based layer 3 IP VPN is mostly in the hands of the operator configuring the service and the network. Thus with regard to security, I do not believe there is a difference when realizing the network based IP VPN service in a public or private IP network. However, a network based IP VPN realized in a public IP network might pose a sales problem because many customers are worried about the security and availability of such a network.\\nRFC 2547 and MPLS seem to be the way to go in the future, but my recommendation is to make the transition slowly thereby minimizing Capital Expenditures (CAPEX). This is especially true since the current network based IP VPN service has been so well received. Whether Skanova should introduce MPLS and RFC 2547 in the IP network or the ATM network is very much dependent on their future strategy. I believe that both the IP network and the ATM network can support a service such as VPN Flex. Also, the way that MPLS will be used with regard to the VPN Flex service is the same.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93177\", \"number-of-pages\": \"96\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-18T14:38:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-12T14:46:38.557+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:57:00.444+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93177\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 96.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:515365\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2002]]}, \"title\": \"A Comparative Study ofTwo Multicast Routing Algorithms\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Berggren\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Borg\", \"given\": \"Martin\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Johnsson\", \"given\": \"Martin\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Enea Data AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This Master Thesis examines several aspects of two different multicast forwarding algorithms. The scaling properties of the currently used algorithms were examined under different criteria, such as delay, traffic concentration, and size of the routing tables.\\nMany new Internet applications, such as videoconferencing, resource discovery, Internet radio and online games, depend on a network support for efficient point-to-multipoint communication. Sending identical data to a group of receivers using a series of unicast transmissions obviously has massive scaling problems. Multicasting provides an efficient and elegant solution that significantly reduces the total bandwidth demand as well as the load on both senders and intermediate routers.\\nIn this report we study two multicast routing algorithms, source based trees (SBT) and core based trees (CBT). SBT builds one delivery tree per source and group by flooding the initial packet through the entire network, and then removing the links that do not lead to group members (\\u201cpruning\\u201d). To be able to discover new members, flooding must occur periodically. CBT on the other hand, builds one delivery tree per group, shared by all sources. There is one core router per group and members must explicitly join the delivery tree by notifying the core. Off-tree sources must tunnel their traffic to the core for distribution along the tree.\\nSBT has two main drawbacks. Firstly, the maintenance of the delivery tree requires periodic flooding of the network. Furthermore, SBT routers must keep state that grows as the product of the number of sources and the number of groups. CBT solves both of these scaling problems, but the shared tree will often lead to sub-optimal paths and increased delay. The traffic may also be concentrated on fewer links than in SBT.\\nWe compared the characteristics of the SBT and CBT algorithms in different network topologies using a simulation program. Since existing network simulation tools were found to be poor when it came to multicasting, we decided to develop a new network generator and simulator tool with multicasting aspects in focus. We also developed a tool to visualize the networks generated by the simulator and monitor the traffic. The report presents many simulation results that illustrate the significance of different trade-offs between SBT and CBT. Performance characteristics such as delay, join latency, tree size, total traffic and traffic concentration are analysed and examined.\\nThe conclusion is that each protocol can be preferable in certain scenarios, depending on how important the different parameters are. CBT always performs better than SBT for single source applications if the core can be placed at the sender\\u2019s local router. However, this core placement is not necessarily optimal for CBT. The situation is more complex in groups with several sources. There is a trade-off between the scaling problems of SBT and the increased delay and traffic concentration of CBT.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93199\", \"number-of-pages\": \"112\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-18T14:25:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-12T15:40:08.016+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:56:41.686+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93199\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 112.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:510502\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2009]]}, \"title\": \"A Comparison of C++, C#, Java, and PHP in the context of e-learning\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Olsson\", \"given\": \"Mikael\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The first part of this master thesis presents an effective method for producing video tutorials.

One of these opportunities is to make use of its potential as a large scale marketing communication channel. Marketing via the mobile networks, presents a large target audience that can be compared to broadcast media such as television and radio, but despite this can still be a personal channel and hence compared to direct mail or one-to-one marketing.Many, both successful and failed, mobile marketing schemes have been tried, but without any definite answers and no clear action plan.

Context-awareness means that the computer can adapt to the situation in which it is working. Context is a key issue in mobile computing, especially with handheld devices (such as PDAs and mobile phones), due to the fact that they can be used while on the move; hence the environment around them can change. The environment of a static device may also change and require the device to adapt. Applications and systems that exploit context by both sensing and reacting to their environment are called context-aware applications. Devices that are context-aware are able to perceive stimuli and react accordingly, with minimal interaction with the user.\\nProviding context-aware services to users of mobile devices via context-aware applications is becoming an important and significant factor in the market and is a developing industry. In this thesis we analyze and develop an application that exploits context to provide a service that improves the interaction between humans and a computer. The thesis begins with a study of what types of sensors are available to provide information about the device's context. This is followed by the design of an appropriate way of using the selected sensor (ecompass) to provide a means of adapting a service to the user's and device's context. The focus is every day activities of a student at a university - specifically finding the location of a meeting room for a seminar; however, similar scenarios exist for other types of users.\\nAfter determining that it was feasible to add a e-compass as a sensor to an existing personal digital assistant and to provide a map to the mobile user, the focus of the thesis shifted to an examination of the performance of the adaptation of the map as the user moved the device. Initially it required excessive time to render the map on the device, thus as the user moved the device the map was not updated quickly enough for the user to know their correct orientation with respect to the map. Therefore the thesis project examined how this performance could be improved sufficiently that the rendering would keep up with the change in orientation of the device. This investigation lead to a shift from server based rendering of the map as an image, followed by the transfer of the image to the device for display; to a sending a scalable vector graphics version of the map to the device for local rendering. While initially this was expected to be much faster than transferring an image for an actual map of the building where this work was taking place the local rendering was actually slower. This subsequently lead to server based pruning of the irrelevant details from the map, then a transfer of the relevant portion of the map to the device, followed by local rendering.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91111\", \"number-of-pages\": \"79\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"36\", \"keyword\": \"Context-awareness; magnetic field sensor; Scalable Vector Graphics\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-08T09:26:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-07T18:29:26.972+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:30:09.261+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91111\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 79.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1049974\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2016]]}, \"title\": \"A Coordination Framework for Deploying Hadoop MapReduce Jobs on Hadoop Cluster\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Raja\", \"given\": \"Anitha\", \"localId\": \"u1rf65db\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Lu\", \"given\": \"Yue\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Apache Hadoop is an open source framework that delivers reliable, scalable, and distributed computing. Hadoop services are provided for distributed data storage, data processing, data access, and security. MapReduce is the heart of the Hadoop framework and was designed to process vast amounts of data distributed over a large number of nodes. MapReduce has been used extensively to process structured and unstructured data in diverse fields such as e-commerce, web search, social networks, and scientific computation. Understanding the characteristics of Hadoop MapReduce workloads is the key to achieving improved configurations and refining system throughput. Thus far, MapReduce workload characterization in a large-scale production environment has not been well studied.In this thesis project, the focus is mainly on composing a Hadoop cluster (as an execution environment for data processing) to analyze two types of Hadoop MapReduce (MR) jobs via a proposed coordination framework. This coordination framework is referred to as a workload translator. The outcome of this work includes: (1) a parametric workload model for the target MR jobs, (2) a cluster specification to develop an improved cluster deployment strategy using the model and coordination framework, and (3) better scheduling and hence better performance of jobs (i.e. shorter job completion time). We implemented a prototype of our solution using Apache Tomcat on (OpenStack) Ubuntu Trusty Tahr, which uses RESTful APIs to (1) create a Hadoop cluster version 2.7.2 and (2) to scale up and scale down the number of workers in the cluster.The experimental results showed that with well tuned parameters, MR jobs can achieve a reduction in the job completion time and improved utilization of the hardware resources. The target audience for this thesis are developers. As future work, we suggest adding additional parameters to develop a more refined workload model for MR and similar jobs.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-196951\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xviii,41\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2016:172\", \"keyword\": \"Hadoop; Workload Characterization; Parametric Modeling; Coordination framework; OpenStack; Workload deployment; Hadoop; Arbetsbelastning Karakterisering; Parametrisk Utformning; Koordinations system; OpenStack; Arbetsbelastnings Utplacering\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2016-12-06T11:25:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2016-11-27T20:08:52.191+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-27T04:26:50.949+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-196951\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 59.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:843073\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2015]]}, \"title\": \"A Data Model Driven Approach to Managing Network Functions Virtualization : Aiding Network Operators in Provisioning and Configuring Network Functions\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"S\\u00e4llberg\", \"given\": \"Kristian\", \"localId\": \"u1pfo2q2\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Wikstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Claes\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Cisco, Inc.\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Bevemyr\", \"given\": \"Johan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Cisco, Inc.\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Wallin\", \"given\": \"Stefan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Cisco\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This master\\u2019s thesis explains why certain network services are difficult to provision and configure using IT automation and cloud orchestration software.

Moreover, the proposed solution enables network operators to change the configuration at runtime. The work can be seen as a step towards self managing and auto scaling networks.The proposed approach is compared to a well known cloud management system (OpenStack) in order to evaluate if the proposed approach decreases the amount of time needed for network operators to design network topologies and services containing VNFs. Data is collected through observations of network operators, interviews, and experiment.Analysis of this data shows that the proposed approach can decrease the amount of time required for network operators to design network topologies and services. This applies if the network operators are already acquainted with the data modeling language YANG. The amount of time required to provision VNFs so that they respond to connections can also be decreased using the proposed approach. The proposed approach does not offer as much functionality as OpenStack, as it is limited to VNF scenarios.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-171233\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xix,120\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2015:159\", \"keyword\": \"NFV; SDN; VNF; Virtualization; NFV; SDN; VNF; Virtualization\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-07-28T09:53:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-07-24T16:47:24.723+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T13:05:15.751+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-171233\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 139.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:683816\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2013]]}, \"title\": \"A Distributed Approach for Global Product Lifecycle Management\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Vargas-Orellana\", \"given\": \"Julio\", \"localId\": \"u1ir8l0h\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Laudenbach\", \"given\": \"Rolf\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Aras Corp AG\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) is a holistic approach for managing product information throughout its life cycle. It integrates different concepts that have emerged due to changes in the manufacturing process as a result of globalization, increased competition, demand for more innovative products, and other reasons. These changes have leaded to a shift from a model with a single-location for product development to a model in which a complex network of specialized companies collaborate.This global collaborative PLM implies that companies from different parts of the world work together and must share information; hence the underlying PLM system is required to facilitate data management throughout this collaborative process. In addition, it is also necessary to address the challenges due to the new model being a distributed activity, as today this PLM system is a specialized distributed system.Maintaining data consistency can be challenging because collaborators can use heterogeneous PLM systems together with their own databases. The later cannot be shared due to the risks of exposing their knowledge base and business processes. Another consideration in global collaboration is that data is transmitted to remote locations. As a result network latency can be large; this can cause problems particularly when large files are exchanged, such as may be the case for CAD design models.This thesis proposes a solution enabling a global PLM which addresses the challenges described above. The approach consists of connecting collaborators\\u2019 nodes in a network that is constructed by grouping them with respect to intra-site latency. Each group implements a coordination mechanism based on the election of a node which is subsequently in charge of coordinating data access. The groups communicate via a publish-subscribe communication pattern, publishing and subscribing to events related to the resources being shared. The integration of the solution is through a Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) implementing web services that can be consumed by a PLM system. A prototype has been implemented and its applicability is analysed by evaluating its functionality in a collaborative scenario based on the Aras Innovator PLM platform.The evaluation was made by simulating the solution proposed and comparing it with a centralized approach. The results particularly showed that the proposed solution could reduce the intra-latency compared to a centralized approach if the collaborators are organized in collaborative groups, that exchange most of the information inside the group rather than intergroup.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-139105\", \"number-of-pages\": \"ix,55\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:247\", \"keyword\": \"Product Lifecycle Management; distributed systems; cluster head; Product Lifecycle Management; distribuerade system; cluster head\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-01-07T09:05:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-01-07T08:14:45.950+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T21:30:39.792+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-139105\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 64.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511884\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2007]]}, \"title\": \"A Distributed Approach to Context-Aware Networks : Prototype System Design, Implementation, and Evaluation\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Swenson\", \"given\": \"Markus\", \"localId\": \"u1183a11\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Kanter\", \"given\": \"Theo G.\", \"localId\": \"u10l6taa\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Research\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Utilizing context information and in networks, enabling network services to act upon context information, and exchanging context information with applications, constitutes an important new approach to designing communication systems and central to the research project named Ambient Networks.

The deployed service supports HLS and the emerging ISO/IEC MPEG standard called Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (MPEG-DASH).Live media was the focus of the evaluation, since this content can not be cached in advance at the user's device, hence the quality of the user's experience will be affected by the currently available bandwidth which the user can utilize.

For both the operator and content providers, streaming of media generates most of its revenue through advertisements inserted in the content. One common approach is to pre-stitched (i.e. insert) advertisements into the content. Another approach is dynamic advertisement insertion, which inserts advertisements at run-time while the media is being streamed. Dynamic advertisement insertion gives operators the flexibility to insert advertisements based on context, such as the user's geographic location or the user's preferences. Developing a technique to successfully insert advertisements dynamically into the streaming media has several challenges, such as maintaining synchronization of the media, choosing the appropriate transport format for media delivery, and finding a splicing boundary that starts with a key frame. The details of these challenges are detailed in this thesis.\\nWe carried out extensive research to find the best transport format for delivery of media and we studied prior work in an effort to find an appropriate streaming solution to perform dynamic advertisement insertion.

It introduces a new authenticator that implements such a new non-binary authentication mechanism.\\nIn today\\u2019s wireless local area networks it is generally not possible to continue a multimedia roaming session smoothly, because of the long delay caused by authentication \\u2013 during which no traffic other than authentication traffic is permitted. In the best cases this high delay results in a long communication interruption interval without media, while in the worst cases the session is aborted by the higher layer application as the application believes that the connectivity is lost. Thus introducing a more appropriate authentication mechanism enables mobile users who move into a new wireless local area network cell to continue to send and receive packets with greatly reduced handover latency (in comparison to existing authentication mechanisms). This new authentication mechanism potentially enables seamless roaming for users of conversational multimedia services (for example, a voice over IP call could continue despite a movement from one cell to another).\\nThis thesis demonstrates that it is possible to allow unauthenticated users to immediately begin to communicate, while simultaneously limiting their traffic. These limitations in traffic are implemented by traffic shaping.

Hospitals are complex institutions by nature, and are constantly challenged to improve the quality of healthcare delivered to patients while trying to reduce the rate of medical errors and improve patient safety. Here a simple mistake such as patient misidentification, specimen misidentification, wrong medication, or wrong blood transfusion can cause the loss of a patient\\u2019s life. Misidentification of patients is a common problem that many hospitals face on the daily basis. Patient misidentification is one of the leading causes of medical errors and medical malpractice in hospitals and it has been recognised as a serious risk to patient safety.\\nRecent studies have shown that an increasing number of medical errors are primarily caused by adverse drug events which are caused directly or indirectly by incorrect patient identification. In recognition of the increasing threat to patient safety, it is important for hospitals to prevent these medical errors from happening by adopting a suitable patient identification system that can improve upon current safety procedures.\\nThe focus of this master\\u2019s thesis is the design, implementation, and evaluation of a handheld-based patient identification system that uses radio frequency identification (RFID) and IEEE 802.11b wireless local area networks to identify patients. In this solution, each patient is given a RFID wristband which contains demographic information (patient ID number, ward number, hospital code, etc.) of the patient. A handheld device equipped with IEEE 802.11b wireless local area network connectivity and a RFID reader is then used by the medical staff to read the patient\\u2019s wristband, identify the patient, and access the relevant records of this patient.\\nThis work was carried out at the Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering at the University College Hospital Galway (UCHG), Ireland and the National University of Ireland, Galway.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92014\", \"number-of-pages\": \"91\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2007-13\", \"keyword\": \"wireless patient identification; positive patient identification; radio frequency identification\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-26T10:47:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T16:07:20.483+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:14:31.840+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92014\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 91.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511675\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2007]]}, \"title\": \"A Presence Server for Context-aware Applications\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Eslami\", \"given\": \"Mohammad Zarifi\", \"localId\": \"u19td70a\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This master\\u2019s thesis project \\u201cA Presence Server for Context-aware Applications\\u201d was carried out at KTH Center for Wireless Systems (Wireless@KTH).

Additionally the thesis also explores some of the related technology, in order to provide the reader with suitable background information to understand the rest of the thesis. By using the SIP Express Router (SER) and its presence module (pa) a context server has been designed, implemented, and evaluated. Evaluation reveals that the critical bottleneck is the increasing service time as the number of Publish messages for different events in the SER database increases, i.e. the time required for handling and sending the Notify messages when a new Publish message is received increases as a function of the number of earlier Publish messages. The evaluation also shows that the dependence of SER upon the MySQL database as incorrect database queries can cause SER to crash. Additionally the performance of the database limits the performance of the context server. A number of future improvements are necessary to address security issues (in particular the authentication of Watchers) and adding policy based control in order to send Notify messages only to the Watchers authorized to receive information for a specific event.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91937\", \"number-of-pages\": \"160\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2007-27\", \"keyword\": \"Context; Context-aware; SIP; SIP-SIMPLE; XML; PIDF; SER; Presence Agent module; Subscribe message; Publish message; Notify message\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T13:57:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-22T16:20:15.805+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:15:34.748+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91937\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 160.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:456514\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2011]]}, \"title\": \"A Proxy for Distributed Hash Table based Machine-to-Machine Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Li\", \"given\": \"Daoyuan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": null, \"abstract\": \"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been an increasingly interest for both researchers and entrepreneurs.

The proposed highly scalable database system is designed to support a Remote Patient Monitoring system (RPMS). In an RPMS, a wide range of applications are enabled by collecting health related measurement results from a number of medical devices in the patient\\u2019s home, parsing and formatting these results, and transmitting them from the patient\\u2019s home to specific data stores. Subsequently, another set of applications will communicate with these data stores to provide clinicians with the ability to observe, examine, and analyze these health related measurements in (near) real-time. Because of the rapid expansion in the number of patients utilizing RPMS, it is becoming a challenge to store, manage, and process the very large number of health related measurements that are being collected. The primary reason for this problem is that most RPMSs are built on top of traditional relational databases, which are inefficient when dealing with this very large amount of data (often called \\u201cbig data\\u201d).This thesis project analyzes scalable data management to support RPMSs, introduces a new set of open-source technologies that efficiently store and manage any amount of data which might be used in conjunction with such a scalable RPMS based upon HBase, implements these technologies, and as a proof of concept, compares the prototype data management system with the performance of a traditional relational database (specifically MySQL). This comparison considers both a single node and a multi node cluster. The comparison evaluates several critical parameters, including performance, scalability, and load balancing (in the case of multiple nodes). The amount of data used for testing input/output (read/write) and data statistics performance is 1, 10, 50, 100, and 250 GB.The thesis presents several ways of dealing with large amounts of data and develops &amp; evaluates a highly scalable database that could be used with a RPMS. Several software suites were used to compare both relational and non-relational systems and these results are used to evaluate the performance of the prototype of the proposed RPMS. The results of benchmarking show that MySQL is better than HBase in terms of read performance, while HBase is better in terms of write performance. Which of these types of databases should be used to implement a RPMS is a function of the expected ratio of reads and writes. Learning this ratio should be the subject of a future thesis project.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-124603\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiv,86\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:195\", \"keyword\": \"Big data; database performance; scalability; load balancing; Remote Patient Monitoring System; Big data; databas; prestanda; skalbarhet; lastbalansering; Remote Patient Monitoring System\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-07-18T13:10:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-07-18T12:34:55.038+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T23:50:46.956+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-124603\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 100.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:540758\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"A Security Study for Non-Internet Connected Managed Software\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Galassi De Orchi\", \"given\": \"Tommaso\", \"localId\": \"u1zdn2sp\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Fransson\", \"given\": \"Jonas\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"SCANIA CV AB\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Jarngren\", \"given\": \"Fredrik\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"SCANIA CV AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This master thesis project aims to improve the security of managed software developed at SCANIA's research and development group NEVE.

Moreover enhanced security features, mobility support, and cost reduction features of VoIP are making it a popular choice for personal communication. Due to its rapid growth in popularity VoIP is rapidly becoming the next generation phone system.\\nLawful interception is a mean of monitoring private communication of users that are suspected of criminal activities or to be a threat to national security.

Due to the tremendous increase of users, the WWW-servers cannot response to all the arrived requests. Thus a large number of users are denied services. A simple solution to this problem is to create a system with several servers with different Internet addresses and one common host name. The present WWW technologies allow to map a host name to a random IP address. This solution has some drawbacks and is not a scalable solution.Today's WWW service offers the users to retrieve documents. Many users are not satisfied with only one service. Different types of users wish to get different types of services. Demands for introducing new types of services like publishing electronic newspapers, audio- and video-on-demand and other services in the World Wide Web (WWW) are very high. The requirements of those services are different from the present WWW server technology.Integrating different new types of services in a common platform like WWW is a challenge. Thus there is a need for new technologies that will be developed and adding extra functionality's to the present WWW technology.\\u00a0 This technology should also be scalable with respect to large number of users as well as any number of different types of services.I have studied the problems around the WWW-concept and propose an application server that will work as a scheduler in the WWW. My model suggests to bring changes on both the clients and the servers. My suggestion is to make a micro-client and a micro-server to negotiate and establish the communication-link. On the server side several processes have to be present to offer the services. Equivalent to service provider processes there will be client processes presents on the client side for receiving the data. The server processes can be present in the same computer or distributed to a number of computer.The micro-client and micro-server will negotiate with each other to select a server process that will give the service at that moment and a client process to receive the data.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-104040\", \"number-of-pages\": null, \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-10-26T08:25:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-10-25T18:57:44.109+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T02:48:12.844+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-104040\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 0.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:688073\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2014]]}, \"title\": \"A Topologically Aware Resource Management System\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Mobeen\", \"given\": \"Shariq\", \"localId\": \"u1w037vm\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Kronqvist\", \"given\": \"Magnus\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"As companies fight for market share whoever is able to bring products to market faster has an advantage over their competitors. Therefore it is absolutely essential to constantly evaluate and optimize processes to achieve shorter time-to-market for products.These optimizations have to be carried out in all parts of a company. This thesis describes one such attempt made by a Swedish telecommunication vendor focused on enabling a resource management system to gain a greater understanding of the resources available during testing. This system manages all of the hardware utilized by the users, software testers, within one particular part of the organization and aids users by automatically converting the information stored in its database into a configuration file that will later be used in the testing framework\\u2019s execution environment. Unfortunately, the current version of this resource management system lacks semantic understanding of the information necessary to automatically generate the configuration file, leaving a rather large part of the configuration file to be manually entered by the testers, a rather time-consuming task. The inability to completely automate the process means that the testing process is slower, more error prone, and increases the work needed for a new engineer to become a productive software tester.In order for the resource management system to automatically generate the configuration file it needs to know not only which resources it is managing, but must also how these resources are interconnected, i.e. the topology of the resources. For this reason this thesis describes how to make the resource management system topologically aware, thus making verification of the System under Test (SUT) more efficient and mitigating the problems mentioned above. This thesis does not deal with the intricate details of how to automatically extract the topology, as this is inherently domain specific and thus difficult to generalize. Rather, this thesis focused on how to allow users to custom-build their desired topology by defining a set of rules that restrict how resources can be interconnected.The goal of providing functionality for storing and retrieving topological information from database has been successfully achieved, and the resulting code has been integrated into the existing resource management system. However, the functionality has not yet been delivered because of a limitation in our front controller that stops us from providing an efficient web interface to our tool. After delivery the implemented solution is expected to remove most manual work related to test configuration and therefore also reduce the learning curve for new engineers.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-139949\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,100\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2014:1\", \"keyword\": \"Topology; Resource Management System; SUT; Testing; Topologi; Resurshanteringssystem; SUT; Testning\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-01-16T21:00:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-01-15T17:54:34.211+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T21:21:52.159+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-139949\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 113.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:507866\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2011]]}, \"title\": \"A Web Server for Sensors\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Tian\", \"given\": \"Ye\", \"localId\": \"u1jh5fbo\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This thesis describes the project \\u201cA new Web Server for sensors\\u201d. The project has created a demonstration web service that can receive data from sensors ( both fixed sensors and movable sensors) and distribute the received information in the form of web pages. These web pages can provide forms that enable the user to enter commands which are to be given to sensors. The aim of this thesis project was to design and evaluate web-based application which could utilize sensor data. In this project, we focused on two aspects: (1) web access to sensors and (2) the potentialmobility of sensors. The web server provides web server mediated access to the sensors. Additionally, this project examined how to integrate a sensor with a mobile device, such as a personal data appliance. The web server provides an easy acces smechanism to users who want to use and control sensors. Those users can flexibly us etheir web browser to access to sensors through our web server. Moreover, a sensor could move, for example because it is integrated with a personal data appliance. The mobility of sensors increases the sensing scope of sensors because the sensors are notfixed in position. Such sensors can sense the environment along the path that they are moved.\\nTo achieve the goals of this thesis project, we analyzed what are the basic parts and functions that should exist for sensors in the web server. Furthermore, the thesis analyzed how a sensor can be integrated with a personal data appliance, for instance,how to supply the power to sensor; and how to synchronize data between the sensor and personal data appliance. As a result of this project, a web server with some of the necessary functions was developed. An approach of how to integrate a sensor with a personal data appliance is specified in this thesis.\\nThe thesis begins with an analysis of some existing solutions. Their advantages were used to specify the requirements for our own solution. The thesis describes the design and implementation of this proposed solution. Next the thesis describes the testing and evaluation of this solution in the context of this project.

The biggest challenge of information and communication technology (ICT) today is to transition from IPv4 to IPv6. The purpose of this thesis is to accelerate the adoption of IPv6 by highlighting the benefits of it compared to IPv4.Although the need for more IP-addresses is the most urgent incentive for the transition to IPv6, other factors also exist. IPv6 offers many improvements to IPv4 which are necessary for the continued expansion of Internet-based applications and services.Some argue that we do not need to transition to IPv6 as the problems with IPv4, mainly the addressshortage, can be solved in other ways. One of the methods of doing this is by extending the use of Network Address Translators (NATs), but the majority of experts and specialists believe that NATs should not be seen as a long-term solution.Another difficulty with the new protocol is explaining its benefits and areas of use to both the business world and the public. Understanding these benefits are necessary in order create awareness of these benefits, thus to accelerating the adoption of IPv6.

Based on a literature study, remote workers were found to lack social interactions that happen automatically in an office. Therefore, a proposed solution of scheduling regular, social, and informal interaction sessions was tested in an experiment using Microsoft Teams with full-time, remote IT workers. To facilitate informal social interactions during these experiment sessions, the participants were allowed to play a few different games, participate in social activities or not participate at all. Analysis of the results from the experiment showed a slight improvement in the measured factors over the course of the experiment. However, only a decrease in emotional exhaustion was found to be statistically significant. Therefore, the results are insufficient to argue for or against the implementation of regular informal social interactions with a goal of improving employees\\u2019 remote working environment. The experiment had several areas which could be improved, particularly the scale and availability of the experiment. Future research should take into account the suggested areas of improvement for the experiment, specifically scaling up a similar experiment in order to support or refute the implementation of regular social interactions as part of a remote working environment. The increase in remote work is believed to persist in the future. Therefore, the drawbacks of remote work merit additional research to uncover techniques to mitigate them.

This masters thesis addresses first the issue of the architecture of the context network and then some tests to measure the performances of the proposed solution.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92199\", \"number-of-pages\": \"44\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2006-4\", \"keyword\": \"Context Aware Services; Context Information; Discovery\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-29T08:41:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-28T15:00:07.158+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:11:25.175+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92199\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 44.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:510974\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2008]]}, \"title\": \"Adaptive Video Streaming : Adapting video quality to radio links with different characteristics\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Ekl\\u00f6f\", \"given\": \"William\", \"localId\": \"u1bhmiju\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Dovstam\", \"given\": \"Kristofer\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Research\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"During the last decade, the data rates provided by mobile networks have improved to the point that it is now feasible to provide richer services, such as streaming multimedia, to mobile users. However, due to factors such as radio interference and cell load, the throughput available to a client varies over time. If the throughput available to a client decreases below the media\\u2019s bit rate, the client\\u2019s buffer will eventually become empty. This causes the client to enter a period of rebuffering, which degrades user experience. In order to avoid this, a streaming server may provide the media at different bit rates, thereby allowing the media\\u2019s bit rate (and quality) to be modified to fit the client\\u2019s bandwidth. This is referred to as <i>adaptive streaming</i>.\\nThe aim of this thesis is to devise an algorithm to find the media quality most suitable for a specific client, focusing on how to detect that the user is able to receive content at a higher rate. The goal for such an algorithm is to avoid depleting the client buffer, while utilizing as much of the bandwidth available as possible without overflowing the buffers in the network. In particular, this thesis looks into the difficult problem of how to do adaptation for live content and how to switch to a content version with higher bitrate and quality in an optimal way.\\nThis thesis examines if existing adaptation mechanisms can be improved by considering the characteristics of different mobile networks. In order to achieve this, a study of mobile networks currently in use has been conducted, as well as experiments with streaming over live networks. The experiments and study indicate that the increased available throughput can <b>not</b> be detected by passive monitoring of client feedback. Furthermore, a higher data rate carrier will <b>not </b>be allocated to a client in 3G networks, unless the client is sufficiently utilizing the current carrier. This means that a streaming server must modify its sending rate in order to find its maximum throughput and to force allocation of a higher data rate carrier. Different methods for achieving this are examined and discussed and an algorithm based upon these ideas was implemented and evaluated. It is shown that increasing the transmission rate by introducing stuffed packets in the media stream allows the server to find the optimal bit rate for live video streams without switching up to a bit rate which the network can not support.\\nThis thesis was carried out during the summer and autumn of 2008 at Ericsson Research, Multimedia Technologies in Kista, Sweden.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91662\", \"number-of-pages\": \"102\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2008-28\", \"keyword\": \"Streaming; Bit rate adaption; Video Quality; RTP; RTCP; GPRS; EDGE; UMTS\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-20T10:11:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-19T15:37:32.278+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:20:00.970+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91662\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 102.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:512696\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2006]]}, \"title\": \"Adaptive Wireless Multimedia Services\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Yi\", \"given\": \"Xiaokun\", \"localId\": \"u1g863eo\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Context-awareness is a hot topic in mobile computing currently. A lot of importance is being attached to facilitating the user of various mobile computing devices to provide services that are more \\u201cuser-centric\\u201d. One aspect of context-awareness is to perceive variations in available resources, and to make decisions based on the feedback to enable applications to automatically adapt to the current environment.\\nFor Voice over IP (VoIP) software phones (softphones), variations in network performance lead to fluctuations in the quality of the communication. Therefore, by making these softphones more adaptive to the network environment will, to some extent, mask such fluctuations. Dynamic voice and video adaptation derives from the fact that different coder-decoders (CODEC) have different characteristics, even the same CODECs with a different configuration can behave quite differently, in terms of bandwidth consumption, packet size, etc.\\nMinisip is a VoIP client application which was implemented on and targeted for a Linux platform. One of my tasks was to port Minisip to Microsoft\\u2019s Windows Mobile operating system, running on an HP IPAQ Pocket PC H5550. Such handheld computer enables the user to communication while they are moving about, thus increasing the probability that the characteristics of the network connection will change. Building upon this port, the next task was to add dynamic voice and video CODEC adaptation. Dynamic voice and video CODEC adaptation on Minisip poses several challenges, for example, in what way can the network performance be determined and what adaptation strategy can achieve high call quality while making efficient utilization of available network resources.\\nIn order to make the proper design choices, several estimation models will be discussed, these are used to determine an efficient, un-intrusive, and light weight means of dynamic CODEC selection within Minisip.

In many networks, clients can use resources only after they have been authenticated by an authentication server and authorized to use these resources. In some cases the server will also maintain accounting records in order for an operator (a provider of resources) to charge the account/subscriber for using the service. There are four main AAA protocols being used today. Of these RADIUS is the mostly widely used.\\nThis thesis starts with an introduction to AAA protocols, and then goes in the details of RADIUS. In order to perform a practical evaluation of how the AAA could be improved, FreeRADIUS was selected as the base code for this project; because this implementation is one of the most widely used RADIUS servers. A proposal for how to improve AAA performance is introduced and the implementation steps needed to realize these improvements are shown. Additionally, some experiments have been conducted to show both the correct functioning of the resulting implementation and to examine if there is a performance improvement. Following this some conclusions are drawn based upon a comparison with a traditional AAA server.\\nA key element of the change in AAA which is proposed is the use of a non-binary IEEE 802.1x process. This new non-binary solution introduces a new type of AAA server and requires the re-thinking of a number of traditional AAA design decisions. It is expected that this change will have a significant impact, but will require some time for exposure, implementation by others, and a more extensive evaluation that was possible during the period of this thesis project.\\nOne of the most important conclusions drawn during this thesis is the difficulty of making a change in authentication and authorization, because of the large amount of interaction between both the various protocols and the standards which have been developed for these protocols. Thus one of the difficult aspects of the task is how to introduce a change in a protocol while maintaining backward compatibility for others who have not adopted this change -- without requiring the addition of a protocol version field.\\nA second important conclusion is that doing this implementation in three separate parts with different students being responsible for the different parts revealed just how complex the interaction of protocol design decisions are. While a working version of the entire set of changes proved to be impossible, it was observed that the different parts could be decoupled more than initially expected.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91684\", \"number-of-pages\": \"104\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2008-19\", \"keyword\": \"AAA; RADIUS; FreeRADIUS; authentication; non-binary authentication; IEEE 802.1x\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-20T10:37:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-19T16:50:17.110+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:19:29.941+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91684\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 104.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:531126\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"Adding Gigabit Ethernet to an ATM Switch\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Badinson (nee Hossieni)\", \"given\": \"David\", \"localId\": \"u1e80ym2\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}, {\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Nordmark\", \"given\": \"Roger\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Telecom AB, Datacom Networks and Services\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This document contains the outcome of the final version of my thesis project: Adding Gigabit Ethernet access to an ATM switch.

Because of this some limitations of testing are justified.In order to limit the scope of this thesis I have selected some of the most appropriate methods for testing, and will only examine these specific methods.\\u00a0 The focus for the testing is not specifically to find errors, but rather to confirm that the product offers the specified functionality.This thesis describes an approach to functional testing of an application for Symbian mobile devices based upon log analysis. Unfortunately, testing applications on mobile devices is still not straightforward, and this thesis does not shed any light upon how to lessen this complexity. However, I believe that both testing and development will be more and more built around use cases in the future. Unfortunately, automation of testing based uponthese use cases will be further complicated by the increasing use of touch screens and physical input (such as gestures).\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-116778\", \"number-of-pages\": \"43\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:13\", \"keyword\": \"Mobile testing; Symbian; Automate; Bug tracker; Mobil testning; Symbian; Automatisering; Felrapporteringssystem\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-01-28T07:33:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-01-27T23:24:41.816+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T01:24:07.353+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-116778\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 43.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:528522\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1998]]}, \"title\": \"An Archive Robot for Video Mail\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Dimitriou\", \"given\": \"Eleftherios\", \"localId\": \"u1h9sile\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Today most of the real-time voice communications are carried over the Plain Old Telephone System (POTS).

It opens up new possibilities for global communication. But the number of services is growing, and you get more and more addresses to keep track of \\u2013 one or more for each service (email, homepage, etc.). Not only that, the addresses are tied to your employer, school, or service provider. That is, they are not very portable and persistent. Another problem is how to integrate Internet telephony with ordinary telephony. Besides setting up the necessary infrastructure, for example gateways, one of the biggest problems is the addressing incompatibility. Phones on the telephone network use telephone numbers while hosts on the Internet use IP addresses or domain names. How can you call a host named foo.ellemtel.se from an ordinary telephone, as you can only dial numbers?\\nThis thesis begins with a general introduction to concepts and previous work related to the problems described above. Then two approaches aiming to solve these problems are presented. They are based on Unique Identification Numbers, or UINs, which are globally unique, persistent, and portable addresses. All of your addresses can be aggregated under one UIN, which acts as an alias for your real addresses. A real address could be found by specifying an UIN along with the desired service. And since UINs have E.164 number format, they can be used on both the Internet and in the telephony network, thus eliminating the incompatibility problem. For example, when you send an email to an UIN the real email address will be looked up and used transparently to the user.\\nThe UIN architecture is based on DNS and directory services (LDAP, Whois++, etc.), and lives side-by-side with normal addressing. The scalability of DNS is combined with the flexibility of directory services.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-96523\", \"number-of-pages\": \"57\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-14T10:42:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-05T15:34:14.265+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:19:08.417+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-96523\", \"note\": \"The full text of the thesis can be found at:\\nhttp://www.student.nada.kth.se/~d93-jsv/exjobb/reports/js_addressing_architecture.pdf\", \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 57.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511398\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2008]]}, \"title\": \"An Intelligent Presentation System\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Lidan\", \"given\": \"Hu\", \"localId\": \"u17kruxm\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The master thesis project - Personal video: An Intelligent Presentation System (IPS) - was conducted at the Department of Communication Systems, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden.

Effective in this context means that a visualization can be understood accurately or rapidly by the viewer. However, how to visualize geospatial time series data effectively is challenging. The challenge consists of how to visualize geospatial time-dependent data in a single view that can provide both an effective overview and details of the data set. With three or more data dimensions the available coding options grows; hence, the challenge consists in combining several visual coding and viewing options into a single effective view. This thesis investigated visualization guidelines that should promote effectivness for a visualization of geospatial time-dependent data. Furthermore, in this project the data set consisted of historical air temperature measurements in Sweden, which has both geospatial and time-dependent features. The guidelines where used in an iterative design process to redesign an existing geospatial time series visualization. The goal of the redesign was to increase the effectiveness of the existing visualization. An alternative visualization was created and compared to the original visualization in a user study. The results indicate that these users experienced the alternative visualization as more effective than the original. However, the performance of the participants on four tasks indicates that the alternative visualization is not more effective. Furthermore, compared to related work the alternative visualization is not more effective. In conclusion, the alternative visualization is harder to learn than the original which may have an effect on the user\\u2019s performance. However, once the visualization is learned, then it may be more effective than the original visualization.

The increasing demand for network bandwidth is becoming a huge problem. To solve this problem, new methods must be developed. Ericsson\\u2019s solution is the use of MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS). MPLS has the potential to have a major impact on IP networking. It has the simplicity and dynamic nature of an IP network, but retains the performance of an ATM network. Furthermore, from an administrator\\u2019s point of view, MPLS will drastically simplify network management.\\nThe key principle behind MPLS is to be able to forward by switching packets through a network instead of routing packets. In order to do this, paths are established at the data link layer throughout the MPLS network. A fixed length identifier known as \\u201clabel\\u201d identifies each path. Then the packets are simply forwarded on the path using layer two switching, instead of performing layer three routing.\\nBy using MPLS, performance is increased and it provides a good basis for traffic engineering, Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees, and Virtual Private Networks (VPN).\\nI have implemented an MPLS ATM driver for an Ericsson AXI 510 Edge Router. The driver is responsible for converting generic MPLS labels into standard ATM labels (VPI/VCI). The driver also modifies the forwarding process in the router so that ATM paths are used to forward the packets, instead of the conventional forwarding methods. This implementation has been partly tested and it complies with MPLS current Internet drafts so far.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95463\", \"number-of-pages\": \"61\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-15T08:01:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-05-25T14:48:04.204+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:29:21.984+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95463\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 61.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:938973\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2016]]}, \"title\": \"Analysis and Evaluation of Network Management Solutions : A Comparison of Network Management Solutions Suitable for Networks with 2,500+ Devices\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Gabdurahmanov\", \"given\": \"Murat\", \"localId\": \"u1ii1v1b\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Trygg\", \"given\": \"Simon\", \"localId\": \"u13xh64b\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Erdogan\", \"given\": \"Yeliz\", \"affiliation\": []}], \"abstract\": \"Some companies today are using sub-optimal and nearly obsolete management systems for their networks.

As one of the most successful and popular UGC systems, YouTube contributes a great share of Internet traffic volume and has attracted a lot of academic interest. The continuously increasing amount of IP traffic motivates the need for better network design, more efficient content distribution mechanisms, and more sustainable system development. Web caching is one of the widely used techniques to reduce the inter Internet Service Provider (ISP) traffic. Web caching is considered an important part in the design of a content distribution infrastructure.This master\\u2019s thesis utilizes a one month trace of YouTube traffic in two residential networks in Sweden. Based upon a systematic and in-depth measurement we focus on analyzing the geographic locality of traffic patterns within small areas for these two networks. We summarize the YouTube traffic characteristics and user replay patterns, and then discuss why caching can be useful for YouTube-like systems.We present the optimal caching gain on a per area basis and also divide users into two groups: PC and mobile device users to show the caching gain for these two groups. Overall, an infinite capacity proxy cache for each small area could reduce the YouTube streaming data traffic by 30% to 45%. The result presented in this paper help us to understand YouTube traffic and user behaviors and provides valuable information for the ISPs to enable them to design more efficient caching mechanisms.When this work began we thought that a reduction of backhaul traffic (especially for mobile operators) may delay the need to make investments in upgrading their network capacity. However, an important conclusion from this thesis project is that the cache efficiency depends on the terminal type. For mobile terminals (smart phones, iPads, etc) a terminal cache solution is found to be the most efficient. For PCs in fixed networks, a network cache would be more efficient. It should be noted that the mobile terminals covered in the project are connected through home Wi-Fi, so further research is needed in order to draw definite conclusions for caching solutions for cellular networks.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-104195\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,60\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:246\", \"keyword\": \"UGC; YouTube; Geographic locality; Caching gain; UGC; YouTube; geografiskt definierade populationer; mellanlagring\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-10-31T14:06:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-10-30T08:57:09.810+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T02:45:59.830+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-104195\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 73.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:460412\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2011]]}, \"title\": \"Anonymous Authentication Using Secure Multi-Party Computations\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Ahmad\", \"given\": \"Maqsood\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Typical authentication systems provide a method to allow registered users access to protected resources after the user successfully authenticates. A user successfully authenticates by proving his or her valid identity if he or she is a registered user. During a typical authentication process, the authentication server can directly or indirectly learn the actual identity of the user who authenticates. However, the user might not want any one to know the actual identity of the user, while still able to authenticate. This problem of user\\u2019s anonymous authentication is the focus of this thesis project. This thesis project provides a solution for user\\u2019s anonymous authentication using Secure Multi-party Computation (SMPC). In SMPC, the user information is distributed among the authentication servers, using a secret sharing scheme, in such a way that none of the authentication servers individually possesses all the information of a user.However, these authentication servers can validate the user using some SMPC arithmetic operations. This thesis project provides a model for anonymous authentication and couples this anonymous authentication system with the Open Authentication Protocol (OAuth) to allow the user access to protected resources on the server. The model is explained using UML collaborations and SDL state transition diagrams. An analysis of the model is provided to ensure the security of the proposed system. A skeleton of the proposed model is provided which needs to be completed with appropriate code to realize the functionalities.

PONs are being tried as a method of extending optical fibres into the access network. PONs offer the ability of sharing the transmission costs of the access network amongst a large number of customers by allowing fibre and bandwidth sharing via passive optical splitters. ITU-T recommendation G.983 defines a specification for ATM based PONs. An SDL model was used in the project to investigate the possibility of using the Ericsson ATM switch (AXD 301) as the head-end in a G.983 compliant PON (i.e., the OLT). Also some simulations was made, using SDT. The results indicated that the ATM switch could very well serve as an OLT (by addition of a connection board). It was concluded that although the complexity of the system is quite high (caused by the TDMA technique used), it is a feasible solution. A techno-economical analysis made in the initial part of this project indicates that PONs are too expensive for deployment in the near future, compared to enhanced copper networks using xDSL technology. However, new applications could boost demand for high bandwidth sooner than expected. In any case, PONs (except in the FTTH configuration) constitute a natural upgrade for enhanced copper networks.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95451\", \"number-of-pages\": \"57\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-15T07:54:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-05-25T12:44:34.304+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:29:39.066+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95451\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 57.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:536315\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1995]]}, \"title\": \"ATM UNI 155 MB/s Interface\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Mickos\", \"given\": \"Lars-Erik\", \"localId\": \"u13rjgda\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Vatn\", \"given\": \"Jon-Olof\", \"localId\": \"u1op1pjc\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Raquette\", \"given\": \"Erik\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"ATM is the backbone network selected by the CCITT to carry the future B-ISDN services.

These devices coexist, on many occasions, with non-portable devices, such as fixed phones and personal computers. All these devices have something in common. The user\\u2019s state is not taken into account when they provide their service. This results in the user being constantly interrupted, when not desired or missing very urgent notification(s) if the devices are turned off. Additionally, having so many different devices, each providing unique and different notifications, consumes unnecessary time from the user, who must attend to them separately.In order to improve this situation we seek to exploit the improvements in the fields of speaker and speech recognition, and text to speech synthesis. We were also inspired by the concept \\u201cNomadic Radio\\u201d.

This application interacts with several clients, all communicating via the UDP protocol. One of these clients provides a user interface for selecting audio files and determining the order in which to play them. Another client uses text-to-speech synthesis to generate audio alerts. Another client is a player for several different types of audio files, enabling a user to listen to these files (songs in different formats, notifications,...) all on the same device, resulting in an approximation of a \\u201cNomadic Radio\\u201d with the sensor rich \\u201cSmartBadge version 4\\u201d as the underlying hardware platform.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93197\", \"number-of-pages\": \"102\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-IMIT-LCN.

In this thesis, we aim to rectify this deficiency by introducing platform independent, exible, and user centric authorization mechanism inSWoT.We derive requirements and design of abstract authorization architecture from the preceding seminal work performed in SENSEI project. SENSEI and SWoT share same problem domain, but while SENSEI addresses enterprise use cases SWoT focusses on consumer use cases. This single but fundamental difference motivates adaptations of SENSEI contributions for application in SWoT. To realize concrete authorization architecture we perform extensive study of various authorization solutions. Results of our study indicate that novel User Managed Access (UMA) protocol represents promising solution for SWoT.We present the Authorization as a Service solution for SWoT framework, based on UMA protocol. This solution enables users to manage and control communication between software agents deployed on smart things and in the cloud from single centralized location.

The software, which will be integrated with Microsoft Windows CE, will automatically select the best interface for internetworking when two or more networks are available.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93279\", \"number-of-pages\": \"81\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-18T14:14:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-13T11:09:27.158+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:55:26.421+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93279\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 81.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:524346\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"Automated Telecommunication Software Testing : An automated model generator for Model-Based Testing\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Gutierrez Lopez\", \"given\": \"Armando\", \"localId\": \"u135mwpc\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Mulas Viela\", \"given\": \"Ignacio Manuel\", \"localId\": \"u1ril9gk\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Karapantelakis\", \"given\": \"Athanasios\", \"localId\": \"u1pz3nue\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"In Model-Based Testing (MBT) the main goal is to test a system by designing models which describe the functionality of the system to test. Subsequently, test cases are obtained from the model, and these test cases can be executed automatically.\\nExperience has shown that the learning curve for learning MBT can be steep - especially for people who do not have previous programming experience. This is because the language used to design models uses programming language concepts. In this thesis we describe a tool which automatically generates models, given an initial set of requirements. The advantage of this tool is that users do not need to learn a model-based testing language to design models, but instead they must learn to use a high-level of abstraction and a Graphical User Interface to specify their test cases.\\nWe demonstrate the value of the tool by using it to design models that generate test cases for telecommunications system, but show that this tool can be adapted for use in testing similar systems. The application of this tool can facilitate traditional phase-based software development methods, by saving a considerable amount of time and resources. In addition, when applied to agile software development, the reduced time required for testing because of the use of our tool helps shortening the feedback loops between designing and testing, thus increasing team efficiency within every iteration.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93852\", \"number-of-pages\": \"151\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:55\", \"keyword\": \"Model-Based Testing; Automated Model Generation; Graphical User Interface; State Chart\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-05-04T08:13:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-05-01T23:33:46.961+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:45:00.902+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93852\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 151.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:526410\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"Automated test procedure for GSM Over-The-Air SIM file management\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Andr\\u00e9\", \"given\": \"Johan\", \"localId\": \"u1y3doxa\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Lindgren\", \"given\": \"Staffan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"AU-SYSMOBILE\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Developments of new Servers for Over-the-Air SIM file management and SIM Toolkit applications require a comprehensive test procedure to verify their operation.

Reliable networks are important to deliver services that live up to customers' expectations. Tests are frequently run on Ericsson's systems in order to identify stability problems in their networks. These tests are not always completely reliable. The logs produced by these tests are gathered and analyzed to identify abnormal system behavior, especially abnormal behavior that the tests might not have caught. To automate this analysis process, a machine learning system, called the Awesome Automatic Log Analysis Application (AALAA), is used at Ericsson's Continuous Integration Infrastructure (CII)-department to identify problems within the large logs produced by automated Radio Base Station test loops and processes. AALAA is currently operable in two versions using different distributed cluster computing platforms: Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop. However, it needs improvements in its machine-to-machine communication to make this process more convenient to use. In this thesis, message communication has successfully been implemented in the AALAA system. The result is a message bus deployed in RabbitMQ that is able to successfully initiate model training and abnormal log identification through requests, and to handle a continuous flow of result updates from AALAA.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-168837\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,28\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2015:55\", \"keyword\": \"Big Data; Machine learning; Message passing; Machine-to-machine communication; Big Data; Maskininl\\u00e4rning; Meddelandes\\u00e4ndning; Maskin-till-maskin kommunikation\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-06-09T10:57:17.904+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-06-09T08:54:47.250+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T13:52:38.918+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-168837\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 41.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:816005\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2015]]}, \"title\": \"Automating Interactions with Web Services : NFC based attendance software in Java\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Johansson\", \"given\": \"Carl\", \"localId\": \"u1k544z9\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Kavosi\", \"given\": \"Soren\", \"localId\": \"u1nuxs5n\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Today we use an obsolete way of handling information regarding which student and/or teacher is attending which class/lab/seminar, attendance is written down on a piece of paper and collected so that an administrator can manually enter this information to some data processing system.This method is far from optimal and demands a lot of time and resources from administrators, teachers, and students. Correct gathering of attendance is important since it is required for specific parts of some courses. We propose to automate the collection of this attendance data, thus enabling students and teachers to simply swipe their NFC-enabled KTH access card in order to enter their name on an attendance list. This will be achieved by creating an application that adds a student to an attendance list by reading information using a NFC/RFID reader and mapping the card\\u2019s UID to a KTHID (a locally unique identifier used within the university) using a database. The resulting attendance list should be formatted in such a fashion that it can easily be uploaded to systems such as KTH Social and Daisy. Ideally these systems will be extended so that instructors/teachers can use this attendance list to automatically create the appropriate entries in these systems to record the student\\u2019s participation in the indicated activity \\u2013 in the process avoiding a lot of manual labor and improving the accuracy of the process.An additional problem is that there is currently no unified system that connects the KTH access card database (BRAVIDA) to the KTH LDAP database (which stores information about KTH students, faculty, and staff). This means that each student\\u2019s access card UID must manually be added to a database together with the student\\u2019s KTHID. However, once this database entry has been made, we can then map from a card number to a KTHID (or the reverse).The purpose behind and expected result of this thesis is a functional prototype of an application that creates an attendance list by reading data from the student or teacher\\u2019s access cards using a NFC reader. This will hopefully stimulate further digitalization in KTH and also encourage more courses to utilize such access card based attendance lists. The result should be less manual effort by students, faculty, and staff, as well as more accurate and timely filing of attendance information for courses.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-168381\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,51\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2015:47\", \"keyword\": \"student attendance; application; access card; NFC reader; prototype; studentn\\u00e4rvaro; applikation; accesskort; NFC-l\\u00e4sare; prototyp\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-06-02T13:45:53.623+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-06-02T12:31:45.814+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T14:05:03.160+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-168381\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 64.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1322389\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2019]]}, \"title\": \"Automatisering av aktiv lyssnare processen inom examensarbetesseminarium : En ut\\u00f6kning av l\\u00e4rplattformen Canvas\", \"language\": \"swe\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Kuvaja Rabhi\", \"given\": \"Karim\", \"localId\": \"u14zycbu\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879305\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"I dagsl\\u00e4get n\\u00e4r studenter fr\\u00e5n Kungliga Tekniska H\\u00f6gskolan (KTH) ska genomf\\u00f6ra en examensarbetspresentation ska det finnas aktiva lyssnare p\\u00e5 plats.

The simulations done for this study will be valid for these network configurations and together with other simulation results it will be valid for a wider range of networks.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98044\", \"number-of-pages\": \"69\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-18T14:46:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-18T12:18:22.471+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:11:37.340+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98044\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 69.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:538029\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1995]]}, \"title\": \"AviVtxW3 : A gateway, WWW to Videotex, Incorporating Videotex into the World Wide Web\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Lundberg\", \"given\": \"Fredrik\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}, {\"family\": \"\\u00d6hman\", \"given\": \"Jan-Erik\", \"localId\": \"u1vj025h\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Klemets\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"localId\": \"u1b7ejx2\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"abstract\": null, \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98558\", \"number-of-pages\": null, \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": \"Videotex; Video Template Language (VITEL) templates\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-29T08:55:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-27T15:54:52.840+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:05:58.649+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98558\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 0.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:516907\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2000]]}, \"title\": \"Bandwidth Broker for DiffServ Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Liu\", \"given\": \"Jian\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Cebri\\u00e1n\", \"given\": \"Pablo\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Datacom Networks\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"For a long time, the service provider industry has expressed a desire for multiple levels of service within the Internet. Differentiated Services (DiffServ) appeared in mid-1997 is a scheme designed to achieve this. The DiffServ architecture is based on a simple model where the traffic entering a network is classified and possibly conditioned at the boundaries of the network, and then assigned to different behavior aggregates. It is done by edge routers marking the packets. The core routers that forward the packets examine this marking and decide how the packet should be treated.\\nCompared to the original Type of Service (ToS) approach, the DiffServ effort has undertaken significant development in the area of admission control mechanisms, and this where the real value of the DiffServ approach lies. DiffServ attempts to divide one physical network into several 'virtual' networks with resources being allocated to each of them, by using the mechanisms such as classification, metering, shaping, dropping, queuing and scheduling. An overloaded service class will always yield poor service outcomes. Service quality can only be guaranteed when the traffic volume is limited to a realistic amount.\\nThis master thesis presents a software entity responsible for admission control, called Bandwidth Broker, for a DiffServ network. The idea of a bandwidth broker was introduced as part of the DiffServ architecture by Van Jacobsen. A bandwidth broker in this thesis is limited to being an entity responsible for admission control for bandwidth requests. Being aware of the network topology and the available bandwidth on each link, as well as the service level agreements (SLAs) to it's peering domains, the bandwidth broker can decide whether to admit the traffic to the network or not.\\nThe objective of the thesis is to analyze and evaluate how end-to-end QoS can be achieved by integrating bandwidth brokers with other management tools in a pure DiffServ environment. A prototype of a bandwidth broker in a single domain based on static resource management was designed, implemented and evaluated.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93536\", \"number-of-pages\": \"64\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-20T13:08:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-20T12:03:45.313+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:50:28.333+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93536\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 64.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:541129\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1995]]}, \"title\": \"BeCool (Broadband Enterprise Cooperative Language OR Beteus Cooperative Language)\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Lindblad\", \"given\": \"Janne\", \"localId\": \"u1285pg2\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Bilting\", \"given\": \"Ulf\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Stockman\", \"given\": \"Bernard\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"abstract\": null, \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98557\", \"number-of-pages\": null, \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-07-30T13:54:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-27T12:39:59.443+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T03:58:28.612+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98557\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 0.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:526655\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"Bi-directional Differentiated Services in aBroadband Access Server\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Ejner\", \"given\": \"Mikael\", \"localId\": \"u179lk0p\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Lowe\", \"given\": \"Kerry\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Datacom & IP Services\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Quality of Service (QoS) is a highly desired feature of an IP network.

A system is designed to monitor the measurement process with regards to detector velocity and height. The system will trigger a warning when the minimum detectable activity is too high, as it would lead to inconsistent results.

The robotic wheels and the detector were shown to be sufficiently accurate for the desired measurements.

This has resulted in a wide-spread use of services in order to improve the quality of our daily life. For example, a person with a mobile device can use services to plan and execute his or her travel, to connect to family and friends, to perform his or her search, or to manage his or her business. However, most of these services might only be available at some times, they may lack robustness, and some of these services are not aware of (or do not exploit) the mobility of the user. These services appear impermeable to the end users, i.e. the end users do not get to control or configure the services. We envisage that end users, with no programming knowledge, will have a hard time to find services of their choice and that it will be hard for these end users to derive substantial benefits from these services. Unguided automation is not the answer to this problem, as a particular service suggested automatically by a dynamic composition mechanism may not be suitable for a specific user at a certain point of time and in a given context. On the other hand explicit specification of service instances will mean that the user will be bogged down with the problem of runtime optimization in a dynamic environment where the services having the required functionality may or may not be available.In order to address this issue we introduce the notion of intelligent service composition where the end user will have a great degree of flexibility to define his or her own rules or conditions based on which an optimal composition will be generated automatically from a set of collaborative services by adaptation in a specific context and at a specific point in time. This is a step forward when compared to the present dynamic composition mechanisms which do not facilitate end users defining their own conditions dictating the selection of specific service instance at runtime. We have developed this solution to bring end users towards adaptive use of services. We validated our solution through a scenario-based evaluation approach with an implementation of a proof-of-concept prototype.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-50073\", \"number-of-pages\": \"124\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2011:189\", \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-12-01T15:44:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-12-01T15:44:08.996+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T19:49:06.382+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-50073\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 124.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:510497\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2009]]}, \"title\": \"Collaboration-Oriented Modeling of an Offshore Group Communication System\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Tam\", \"given\": \"Doan Thi Hong\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Kraemer\", \"given\": \"Frank Alexander\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Telenor\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This thesis studies the SPACE method by creating building blocks for a Push to Talk (PTT)service in WLAN environment.

Electronic calendars are especially useful for people who have many different meetings each day and who need to know when the meetings start and who is involved in each meeting.

However, today such software does not utilize context-awareness, for example exploiting knowledge of the user's location.\\nWhen people collaborate they often need to meet in order to do a task jointly or discuss something.

In this thesis, a program that schedules meetings automatically is designed, implemented and evaluated.\\nThis program facilitates collaboration by finding a commonly available time and/or meeting place for a meeting, thus making it easier for the meeting people to agree. When meetings are scheduled without requiring too much attention from a user and the number of human errors can be reduced while planing a meeting, users do not need to expends as much effort as it goes into scheduling meetings today. Because today a company planing a collaboration task collectively spends a lot of time and effort searching for a commonly available time with this effort increasing non-linearly with increased numbers of participants companies can obviously benefit from automated scheduling systems.\\nTesting with the application reveals that incorporating of user's location information into scheduling is a great tool to facilitate collaboration.

The evaluation also shows that the developed scheduling program has managed to reduce the time and effort spent while scheduling meetings.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91110\", \"number-of-pages\": \"118\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"35\", \"keyword\": \"automatic scheduling; ad hoc meetings; location awareness; iCalendar\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-08T10:12:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-07T18:18:43.033+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:30:10.885+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91110\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 118.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1239032\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2018]]}, \"title\": \"Collecting Data for Building Automation Analytics : A case study for collecting operational data with minimal human intervention\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Jan\", \"given\": \"Jonathan\", \"localId\": \"u1n4sqhp\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879654\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Mittler\", \"given\": \"Markus\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Brunswick Real Estate\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Approximately 40% of the total energy consumption within the EU is due to buildings, and similar numbers can be found in the US. If the principal inefficiencies in buildings were easily identifiable, then a facility manager could focus their resources to make the buildings more efficient, which would lead to both cost savings for the facility owners and decrease the building\\u2019s ecological footprint.In building automation systems today, data is already being collected every second, but due to the lack of standardization for describing this data, having access to data is not the same as being able to make use of it. The existing heterogeneity makes it very costly to gather data from multiple buildings, thus making it difficult to understand the big picture.Facility managers cannot fix what they cannot see; thus it is important to facilitate the visualization of the data collected from all of the different building automation systems. This potentially offers great benefits with regards to both sustainability and economy. In this thesis, the author\\u2019s goal is to propose a sustainable, cost and time effective data integration strategy for real estate owners who wish to gain greater insight into their buildings\\u2019 efficiency. The study begins with a literature study to find previous and on-going attempts to solve this problem. Some initiatives for standardization of semantic models were found. Two of these models, Brick and Haystack, were chosen. One building automation system (BAS) was tested in a pilot case study, to test the appropriateness of a solution.The key results from this thesis project show that data from building automation systems, can be integrated into an analysis platform, and an extract, transform, and load (ETL) process for this is presented. How time efficiently data can be tagged and transformed into a common format is very dependent upon the current control system\\u2019s data storage format and whether information about its structure is adequate. It is also noted that there is no guarantee that facility managers have access to the control system\\u2019s database or information about how that is structured, in such cases other techniques can be used such as BACnet/IP, or Open Platform Communications (OPC) Unified Architecture.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-233319\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,40\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2018:735\", \"keyword\": \"Building Automation System; Smart buildings; Big data; Building Management System; Project Haystack; Fastighetsautomationssystem; Smarta byggnader; Big data; Building Management System; Project Haystack\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-11-20T13:52:03.303+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-08-15T12:10:33.178+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T19:48:31.978+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-233319\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 53.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:513045\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2006]]}, \"title\": \"Communication Solutions for Forestry Machines\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Kalantari\", \"given\": \"Leila\", \"localId\": \"u1t8ytng\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Rylander\", \"given\": \"Eva\", \"localId\": \"u1qurkqm\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Johansson\", \"given\": \"Lisa\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Holmen Skog\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Gustafsson\", \"given\": \"Mattias\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Holmen Skog\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"For a long time the forest industry in Sweden has been waiting for nation-wide coverage by the GSM network.

The thesis presents an approach to evaluate performance testing tools concerning requirements from the business domain and the system under test. This approach consists of a user study conducted with four quality assurance experts discussing general performance metrics and specific analytical needs. The outcome of the user study provided the assessment metrics for a comparative experimental evaluation of three open-source performance testing tools (JMeter, Locust, and Gatling) with a realistic test scenario. These three tools were evaluated in terms of their affordance and limitations in presenting analytical details of performance metrics, efficiency of load generation, and ability to implement realistic load models. The research shows that the user study with potential tool users provided a clear direction when evaluating the usability of the three tools.

Due to the rapid growth in the number of users, the amount of processing that must be provided by the company\\u2019s data centers is also growing. This growth in the data centers is necessary, despite the fact that much of the music content is actually sourced by other users based on a peer-to-peer model.\\nSpotify\\u2019s backend (the infrastructure that Spotify operates to provide their music streaming service) consists of a number of different services, such as track search, storage, and others. As this infrastructure grows, some service may behave not as expected. Therefore it is important not only for Spotify\\u2019s operations (footnote: Also known as the Service Reliability Engineers Team (SRE)) team, but also for developers, to understand exactly how the various services are actually communicating. The problem is challenging because of the scale of the backend network and its rate of growth. In addition, the company aims to grow and expects to expand both the number of users and the amount of content that is available. A steadily increasing feature-set and support of additional platforms adds to the complexity. Another major challenge is to create tools which are useful to the operations team by providing information in a readily comprehensible way and hopefully integrating these tools into their daily routine. The ultimate goal is to design, develop, implement, and evaluate a tool which would help the operations team (and developers) to understand the behavior of the services that are deployed on Spotify\\u2019s backend network.\\nThe most critical information is to alert the operations staff when services are not operating as expected. Because different services are deployed on different servers the communication between these services is reflected in the network communication between these servers. In order to understand how the services are behaving when there are potentially many thousands of servers we will look for the patterns in the topology of this communication, rather than looking at the individual servers. This thesis describes the tools that successfully extract these patterns in the topology and compares them to the expected behavior.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-96352\", \"number-of-pages\": \"63\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:63\", \"keyword\": \"Spotify; services; topology; graph; dependencies; coorelation; service behavior; NetFlow; observing network; traffic analysis\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-14T14:15:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-01T18:29:40.755+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:21:50.411+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-96352\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 63.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:908334\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2016]]}, \"title\": \"Comparison of Methods of Single Sign-On : Post authentication methods in single sign on\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Topal\", \"given\": \"Baran\", \"localId\": \"u19rvcgk\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Hammarstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Kent Saxin\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Tacton Systems\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Single sign-on (SSO) is a session verification mechanism that allows a client to use a single password and name combination to be able to access multiple applications. The mechanism validates the client for all the applications and eliminates the need for authentication prompts when a user switches between applications within a session.SSO mechanisms can be classified as software versus hardware or customer-requirements oriented versus server-side arrangements. The five commonly used mechanisms of Single Sign-On currently are: Web Single Sign-On, Enterprise Single Sign-On, Kerberos (or Ticket/Token Authentication), Open ID, and Federation or Federated Identity.SSO has the main benefit of allowing a user to access many different systems without having to log on to each and every one of them separately. However, SSO introduces a security risk as once an attacker gains access to a single system, then the attacker has access to all of the systems.This thesis describes SSO technology, the Security Assertion Markup Language, and the advantages and risks involved in using SSO. It examines authentication mechanisms and their suitability for SSO integration. The main emphasis is a description of a mechanism that ameliorates some of the disadvantages of SSO by monitoring the user behavior with respect to a template. If a user performs actions that fit the defined template behavior, then the post authentication mechanism will not get activated. If, on the other hand, a user does something unforeseen, the mechanism will not perform authentication for this user, but rather trigger manual authentication. If this manual authentication succeeds, then the user will continue to interact with the system, otherwise user session will be ended.This behavior extension authentication mechanism is a method that eases the authentication process in which users are not expected to remember any username and password that can be forgotten easily or have a biometric attribute that can change over time. This method can be integrated to existing web application without a major risk and increase in cost.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-183144\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xvi,117\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2016:14\", \"keyword\": \"SSO; Single sign-on; SAML; authentication; security; behavior; risk; SSO; Single sign-on; SAML; autentisering; s\\u00e4kerhet; beteende; risk\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2016-03-08T16:22:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2016-03-01T17:31:32.522+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T10:02:08.869+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-183144\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 133.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:515387\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2002]]}, \"title\": \"Configuration of a DTM switch\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Liu\", \"given\": \"Jian\", \"localId\": \"u11xiwl2\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6455\", \"name\": \"KTH, Elektroniksystemkonstruktion\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6215\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"DTM, Dynamic synchronous Transfer Mode is a synchronous network protocol based on fast circuit switching.

Furthermore, the behavior of the network observed in these experiments, in terms of real-time performance and statistical analysis of metrics over a period of time, shows the efficiency of this proposed solution.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-142437\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xvii,95\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2014:15\", \"keyword\": \"Radio Access Transport Network; Open Shortest Path First \\u2013 Traffic Engineering; Explicit Congestion Notification; Interface to the Router System; Congestion Identification\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-03-04T14:03:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-03-04T12:40:25.114+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T20:50:55.169+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-142437\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 112.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1221139\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2018]]}, \"title\": \"Connecting Silos : Automation system for thesis processing in Canvas and DiVA\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Besharat  Pour\", \"given\": \"Shiva\", \"localId\": \"u1qpyuu7\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879654\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Li\", \"given\": \"Qi\", \"localId\": \"u1hr9yuk\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879654\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879654\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"As the era of digitalization dawns, the need to integrate separate silos into a synchronized connected system is becoming of ever greater significance. This thesis focuses on the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS) and the Digitala vetenskapliga arkive (DiVA) as examples of separate silos.The thesis presents several methods of automating document handling associated with a degree project. It exploits the fact that students will submit their thesis to their examiner via Canvas. Canvas is the LMS platform used by students to submit all their coursework. When the examiner approves the thesis, it will be archived in DiVA and optionally published on DiVA. DiVA is an institutional repository used for research publications and student theses.When manually archiving and publishing student theses on DiVA several fields need to be filled in. These fields provide meta data for the thesis itself. The content of these fields (author, title, keywords, abstract, \\u2026) can be used when searching via the DiVA portal. It might not seem like a massive task to enter this meta data for an individual thesis; however, given the number of theses that are submitted every year, this process takes a large amount of time and effort. Moreover, it is important to enter this data correctly, which is difficult when manually doing this task. Therefore, this thesis project seeks to automate this process for future theses.The proposed solution parses PDF documents and uses information from the LMS in order to automatically generate a cover for the thesis and fill in the required DiVA meta data. Additionally, information for inserting an announcement of the student's oral thesis presentation into a calendar system will be provided. Moreover, the data in each case will be checked for correctness and consistency.Manually filling in DiVA fields in order to publish theses has been a quite demanding and time-consuming process. Thus, there is often a delay before a thesis is published on DiVA. Therefore, this thesis project\\u2019s goal is to provide KTH with an automated means to handle thesis archiving and publication on DiVA, while doing so more efficiently, and with fewer errors. The correctness of the extracted meta data will be evaluated by comparing the results to the previously entered meta data for theses that have previously been achieved in DiVA. The automated process has been calculated to take roughly 50 seconds to prepare the information needed to publish a thesis to DiVA with ~71% accuracy, compared with 1 hour and 34% accuracy in the previous manual method.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-230996\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,101\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2018:164\", \"keyword\": \"RESTful APIs; Canvas; DiVA; Calendar announcement; data mining; RESTful APIs; Canvas; DiVA; kalendrar; data mining\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-06-20T08:30:04.345+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-06-19T17:06:36.401+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T20:30:52.013+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-230996\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 114.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:536302\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1995]]}, \"title\": \"Construction and Implementation of a Walkstation Mobile-distributed File System Testbed\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Blomberg\", \"given\": \"Patrik\", \"localId\": \"u1o2bt2k\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"In this Master's Thesis an investigation, design and implementation of an object-oriented prototype of a new kind of client-agent-server based distributed file system, suited for wireless mobile computing, are presented.

It is proposed that different cache and prefetch algorithms should be used for different kinds of network links. A cache/prefetch-manager object architecture with automatically location-dependant dynamical swapping of network specific manager objects at run-time is therefore proposed and implemented. A mechanism is designed with which an application optionally can be mobility-aware by subscribing for network-change events.

In order to fully utilize containers, software developers aim to build their software using microservice architecture, meaning that instead of working on a single large codebase for the whole project, the software is split into smaller units. These microservices can be deployed in their own container instead of the traditional virtual machine setup where a server has to configured with all necessary dependencies. Moving away from the monolithic software architecture to containerized microservices is bound to bring performance penalties due to increased network calls between services and container overhead. The integration must therefor be carefully planned in order to fully utilize the container setup while minimizing the overhead. The purpose of this thesis project was to measure how much overhead can be expected due to containers in an enterprise environment. By using a combination of virtual machines and Docker containers, a microservice system was deployed with four different deployment strategies and the system\\u2019s performance was measured by analyzing request response times under various loads. The services were made to run on a single server and on multiple servers, with and without Docker. The performance measurements showed that the system performed worse in every case when Docker was used. Furthermore, the results showed that Docker can have significant negative impact on performance when there is a heavy load on the system.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-235693\", \"number-of-pages\": \"x,62\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2018:599\", \"keyword\": \"Microservices; Containers; Docker; Virtual machines; Cloud computing; Mikroservices; Containers; Docker; Virtuella maskiner; Molntj\\u00e4nster\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-10-03T06:52:06.533+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-10-02T14:07:33.863+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T19:07:23.143+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-235693\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 72.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:521359\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"Content Aware Mobile Email Services\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Hjelm\\u00e9r\", \"given\": \"Johan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Eriksson\", \"given\": \"Henrik\", \"localId\": \"u1t80d6d\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Willehadson\", \"given\": \"Stefan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \" Ericsson Research\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The use and importance of email has increased tremendously over the past few years. Internet users are also becoming increasingly mobile and there has been a recent explosion in the market for small, hand-held Internet connected devices. Email has been identified as a \\u201ckiller application\\u201d for these devices and the race between hardware manufacturers, software houses and service providers to meet the email needs of mobile consumers is on.\\nMeanwhile the use of attachments in email messages has increased and these attachments are becoming more complex, thus requiring more bandwidth. They also often contain graphics such as images and video.\\nThe new small email enabled devices typically have small black and white screens, slow processors and little local storage, i.e. they are not very well suited for downloading and reading email attachments. We therefore propose adding content awareness to email services. By this we mean that email content is adapted to better suit the client before it is downloaded.We have identified two types of adaptions which are applicable: stripping (removing attachments from an email) and thinning (reduction of attachment size).\\nWe have looked at different ways of adding content awareness to an email service. We have implemented an agent based solution which uses multiple inboxes. We chose to call the solution MMAA (Mobile Mail Adaption Agent). The MMAA system is built around a standard IMAP server, a standard IMAP client and a personal Java agent. We have designed, implemented and evaluated the MMAA from a usability and security point of view. It works well, the main objection is that users tend to get confused by the idea of having more than one inbox.\\nWe have also examined the underlying email protocols IMAP and SMTP and suggested an addition to the IMAP protocol which would make it easier to implement future content aware email services. The extension adds a command to IMAP4rev1 called ADAPT. The ADAPT command lets clients communicate their characteristics to the server while fetching mail. The server can then content adapt the mail message according to these characteristics before delivering it to the client. The ADAPT extension has resulted in an Internet draft which can be found in Appendix C of this paper.\\nWhen we analysed the ADAPT extension and compared it to the agent based approach we found that the difference in download time is rather small and we have identified some improvements that could be made. Our conclusion is that the ADAPT extension is definetly the best way to add content awareness to a mobile email service.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93734\", \"number-of-pages\": \"70\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-20T14:14:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-24T17:23:09.537+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:46:51.010+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93734\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 70.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:575001\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"Content Based Addressing : The case for multiple Internet service providers\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"M\\u00f6rt\", \"given\": \"Robert\", \"localId\": \"u1zl0c5j\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Today's Internet usage is changing from host-to-host communication to user-to-content interaction which proves a challenge for Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Repeated requests lead to transfers of large amounts of traffic containing the same content often over costly inter-ISP connections. Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) contribute to solving this issue, but do not directly address the problem. This thesis project explores how content based addressing could minimize inter-ISP traffic due to repeated requests for content by caching content within the ISP's network. We implemented CCNx 0.6.0 in a network testbed in order to simulate scenarios with multiple ISPs interconnected to each other. This testbed is used to illustrate how caching of popular content minimizes inter-ISP traffic as well as how content independence minimizes the effect of other network problems such as link failures and congestion. These tests shows that the large overhead of the CCNx implementation due to the additional headers brings a 16% performance reduction compared to Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) transfers. However, these tests also shows that the cost from the inter-ISP traffic of CCNx transfers are constant regardless of the number of repeated requests, due to content caching in the ISP's network. As soon as there is more than one request for the same content there is a gain in using CCNx rather than HTTP for content transfer.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-107174\", \"number-of-pages\": \"27\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012-300\", \"keyword\": \"content based addressing; CCNx; content caching; inter-ISP traffic\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-12-10T10:40:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-12-07T10:24:13.068+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T02:12:04.417+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-107174\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 27.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:513165\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2005]]}, \"title\": \"Context Aware and Adaptive Mobile Audio\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Rangel Vacas\", \"given\": \"Inmaculada\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}, {\"id\": \"6016\", \"name\": \"KTH, KTH Center f\\u00f6r Tr\\u00e5dl\\u00f6sa System, Wireless@kth\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Today a large percentage of the population uses a handheld (either a mobile phone or a PDA) a laptop computer, or some other computing device. As this penetration increases, the user wants to take as great an advantage of these devices as possible. It is for that reason that communication is demanded almost everywhere. Simply having continuous access to the network is no longer sufficient thus context awareness and easy accessibility are becoming more and more relevant.The idea of this masters thesis is to explore these ideas building on the prior work of Maria Jos\\u00e9 Paraj\\u00f3n Dom\\u00ednguez.

One of these factors could be, for example, what are the effects of having a personal voice interface on the traffic to and from the user\\u2019s mobile device. The aim of this voice interface will be to provide more freedom to the user and also satisfy the demand for greater accessibility and facilitate mobile usage, not only for the common user, but also for handicapped people.

To be able to reach the devices in the PAN from outside in a simple manner, some location independent form of addressing may be used. One attractive approach is to use Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). For a user anywhere in the Internet, SIP enables them to reach a user within this PAN by an address that does not depend on where the user is located.

Since mobile devices feature portability and are (nearly) always connected, people tend to carry them wherever they go. Hence, devices such as cellular phones and Pocket PCs are the most suitable platforms for developing context aware applications which users will utilize in their daily life. For these context aware systems, using this context information not only improves the user experience of ubiquitous computing, but also lets the system know who you are or what you have. More importantly, the device can know where you are and predict what you might like to do, thus simplifying many of the user\\u2019s interactions with devices and other people around them.\\nThis thesis project involves the design, implementation and evaluation of a context aware application, based upon a Pocket PC, that can remind the user of tasks when the user approaches the relevant location for this task. The application interacts with a context aware infrastructure by using the SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE) protocol, receives context information for the user described using XML. A number of new tags, based upon a new XML schema, have been introduced for this task.\\nThis context aware mechanism enables the user to receive any form of information updated by the context server. In this thesis, updates to this information are driven by changes in the user\\u2019s location. Additionally, by using the existing calendar application on the Pocket PC, the user can experience location based reminders without learning how to use a new user interface.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91938\", \"number-of-pages\": \"106\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2007-28\", \"keyword\": \"Context; Context-aware; Pocket PC; reminder; SIP; SIMPLE; XML; PIDF\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T15:25:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-22T16:26:53.951+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:15:33.122+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91938\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 106.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:515047\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2003]]}, \"title\": \"Context-aware Wearable Device for Reconfigurable Application Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Wennlund\", \"given\": \"Andreas\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Kanter\", \"given\": \"Theo G.\", \"localId\": \"u10l6taa\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Research\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Context information available in wearable devices is believed to be useful in many ways. It allows for hiding much of the complexity from the user, thus enabling simpler user interfaces and less user interaction when carrying out tasks on behalf of a user, as well as enabling network operators to provide a better interface to thirdparty service providers who will provide and deliver wireless services. Using the available context information from the wearable device, optimization of service delivery in wireless networks, such as setting up optimal delivery paths between two wearable devices, may be possible without using a third party to do negotiations. In order to fully enable context-awareness, a clear model for how to sense, manage, derive, store, and exchange context information must be defined. This will then provide the platform needed to enable development of context-aware applications that can exploit the possibilities of context-aware computing. The model must take into consideration parameters such as memory usage and power and bandwidth consumption, in order to be efficient on all types of platforms and in all types of networks. It must also be modular enough to survive replacing and upgrading of internal parts.\\nToday little research is available about sensing context information, sensor management, APIs towards other applications, and how and how often to present context information to applications. Since context aware computing relies heavily on the ability to obtain and represent context information, sensing strategies greatly affect efficiency and performance. It is therefore of great interest to develop and evaluate models for carrying out these tasks in order to exploit the results of context awareness research. This thesis will identify and design several components of such a model, as well as test and evaluate the design, in order to be able to make conclusions to whether is lives up to the expectations stated.\\nIn order to make the proper design decisions, a full understanding of the context-awareness research area and the goals and purposes of context-aware computing are required.

Third generation (3G) mobile communication systems such as Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) are not able to satisfy the rising demand for higher throughputs and low latencies. New standards based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), have been proposed and are currently being integrated into existing mobile networks all over the world.LTE specifications are being finalized within the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) with the ambitious goals of increased spectral efficiency and end user throughput. Despite the introduction of several high data rate services, voice communication is still an essential part of the overall wireless wide area cellular communication market. In LTE, the core network is purely packet switched, thus voice is transmitted entirely using a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). Like its predecessor standards it is desired that a large number of simultaneous VoIP calls be supported in LTE, while satisfying the desired Quality of Service (QoS) demands.This thesis examines issues related to VoIP capacity for LTE. One of the key challenges is the limited number of schedulable voice packets per sub frame. The main goal of this thesis is to quantify the impact of this limitation. After describing basic LTE concepts, a detailed description of the control channel resource limitations for the scheduling of voice packets is presented. Consequences of these limitations are explained systematically by presenting the problem in a wider context.Simulation results were obtained using the openWNS Simulator, an event driven system level simulation platform developed at the Communication Networks Research Group (ComNets), RWTH Aachen University Germany. Results are presented showing the impact of different scheduling strategies on VoIP capacity.

One of the main goals of such businesses is to convert as many visitors as possible into customers. Even though many e-commerce businesses already have web analytics tools installed, e-merchants find difficulty in identifying where to start optimizing, what data to extract from analysis reports, and how to make use of such data in order to produce a successful design that will increase the conversion rate. The purpose of this thesis is to (without spending resources on marketing-related factors) guide companies to find a low cost and efficient way to increase the conversion rate by creating well-thought-through designs based on analytic data, qualitative research, and human-computer interaction principles.Google Analytics, a web analytics tool, was used in identifying high-valued pages to optimize and to identify demographics/target groups, while qualitative e-commerce related research was used to shape design-proposal hypotheses. This, along with two A/B tests conducted using Optimizely, is the basis for the guidelines and conclusions.The results of both A/B tests showed an increase in conversions with designs highlighting: evidence of a secure shopping environment, incentives that will attract visitors to buy, and by removing auxiliary navigation elements at the check-out page. The evaluation of the results and its statistical significance was done using both Optimizely\\u2019s statistical engine and null hypothesis testing. The increases in conversions were not statistically significant per Optimizely; however, they were significant using traditional statistics.In conclusion, using metrics such as high exit-rates combined with many page views and high revenue-generating pages will allow e-merchants to identify where to start their optimization process. Furthermore, to know what valuable data needs to be extracted, one should seek the data that needs to be inserted into HCI concepts, such as personas and scenarios. This, along with qualitative research allows designers to create well-thought out design-proposals that will potentially lead to an increased conversion rate.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-207040\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xv,73\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2017:36\", \"keyword\": \"Conversion rate optimization; A/B testing; E-commerce; Quantitative Research; Interaction Design; Human-computer interaction; HCI; Web Design; Statistical Inference; Web Analytics.; Konverteringsoptimering; A/B-testning; e-handel; kvantitativ studie; interaktionsdesign; m\\u00e4nniska-datorinteraktion; MDI; webbdesign; statistisk inferens; webbanalys\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-05-15T12:54:42.544+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-05-13T13:21:06.399+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-27T02:07:21.881+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-207040\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 88.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:513064\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2005]]}, \"title\": \"Corporate Wireless IP Telephony\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Garc\\u00eda Hijes\", \"given\": \"Ra\\u00fal\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"IP telephony is defined as the transport of telephony calls over an IP network.

A range of technologies exist which allow GPUs to be used for general-purpose programming, NVIDIA\\u2019s CUDA platform is one example. CUDA makes it possible to combine source code written for GPUs and Central Processing Units (CPUs) in the same program. Those sections that benefit from parallel execution can be written as CUDA kernels and will be executed on the GPU. With CUDA it is common to have tens, or even hundreds, of thousands of threads running in parallel. While the high level of parallelism can offer significant performance increases for executed programs, it can also make CUDA programs hard to debug. Although debuggers for CUDA exist, they can not be used in the same way as standard debuggers, and they do not reduce the difficulties of reasoning about parallel execution. As a result, developers may feel compelled to fall back to inefficient debugging methods, such as relying on print statements. This project examines two possible approaches for creating a tool which simplifies the process of debugging CUDA programs, by transforming a parallel CUDA program to a sequential program in another high level language: one method centered around the Clang Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and the other method centered around LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) code. The method using Clang was found to be the most suitable for the purpose of translating CUDA, as it enables modifying only select parts, such as kernels, of the input program. Thus, the tool Cumulus was developed as a Clang plugin. Cumulus translates parallel CUDA code into sequential C++ code, allowing developers to use any method available for C++ debugging to debug their CUDA program. Cumulus is indicated to be a potential aid in debugging CUDA programs, by providing developers with increased flexibility.\\u00a0\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-304503\", \"number-of-pages\": \"89\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2021:637\", \"keyword\": \"Clang; Code generation; CUDA; Debugging; Parallel computing; Clang; Kodgenerering; CUDA; Fels\\u00f6kning; Parallella ber\\u00e4kningar\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2021-11-08T08:33:44.805+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2021-11-05T09:56:01.030+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-25T10:14:10.485+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-304503\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 89.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511403\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2008]]}, \"title\": \"Daedalus: A media agnostic peer-to-peer architecture for IPTV distribution\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Makris\", \"given\": \"Athanasios\", \"localId\": \"u1fs9frf\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Strikos\", \"given\": \"Andreas\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Ljunggren\", \"given\": \"Andreas\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"IPTV is gaining increasing attention.

In contrast, peer-to-peer architectures for distributing content have been available for a number of years (since the late 1990\\u2019s), and their success suggests that this is a promising alternative means of distributing content. Although peer-to-peer architectures are well known for file transfer, this kind of architecture has been used in this thesis for distributing streaming video flows.

Our proposal aims to avoid any weaknesses that the existing solutions have, whilst offering a viable solution for distributing live content.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91855\", \"number-of-pages\": \"80\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2008-11\", \"keyword\": \"Peer-to-peer; IPTV; Live multimedia distribution\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-21T12:56:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-21T12:48:54.148+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:16:52.673+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91855\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 80.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:812044\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2015]]}, \"title\": \"Data Transfer and Management through the IKAROS framework : Adopting an asynchronous non-blocking event driven approach to implement the Elastic-Transfer's IMAP client-server connection\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Gkikas\", \"given\": \"Nikolaos\", \"localId\": \"u1bb87np\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Filippidis\", \"given\": \"Christos\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Institute of Nuclear Physics National Center for Scientific Research (NCSR) \\u201cDemokritos\\u201d 15310 Agia Paraskevi, Attica, Greece\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Given the current state of input/output (I/O) and storage devices in petascale systems, incremental solutions would be ineffective when implemented in exascale environments. According to the \\\"The International Exascale Software Roadmap\\\", by Dongarra, et al. existing I/O architectures are not sufficiently scalable, especially because current shared file systems have limitations when used in large-scale environments. These limitations are:<ul><li>Bandwidth does not scale economically to large-scale systems,</li><li>I/O traffic on the high speed network can impact on and be influenced by other unrelated jobs, and</li><li>I/O traffic on the storage server can impact on and be influenced by other unrelated jobs.</li></ul>Future applications on exascale computers will require I/O bandwidth proportional to their computational capabilities. To avoid these limitations C. Filippidis, C. Markou, and Y. Cotronis proposed the IKAROS framework.In this thesis project, the capabilities of the publicly available elastic-transfer (eT) module which was directly derived from the IKAROS, will be expanded.The eT uses Google\\u2019s Gmail service as an utility for efficient meta-data management. Gmail is based on the IMAP protocol, and the existing version of the eT framework implements the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) client-server connection through the \\u2018\\u2018Inbox\\u2019\\u2019 module from the Node Package Manager (NPM) of the Node.js programming language. This module was used as a proof of concept, but in a production environment this implementation undermines the system\\u2019s scalability and there is an inefficient allocation of the system\\u2019s resources when a large number of concurrent requests arrive at the eT\\u2032s meta-data server (MDS) at the same time. This thesis solves this problem by adopting an asynchronous non-blocking event driven approach to implement the IMAP client-server connection. This was done by integrating and modifying the \\u2018\\u2018Imap\\u2019\\u2019 NPM module from the NPM repository to suit the eT framework.Additionally, since the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format has become one of the most widespread data-interchange formats, eT\\u2032s meta-data scheme is appropriately modified to make the system\\u2019s meta-data easily parsed as JSON objects. This feature creates a framework with wider compatibility and interoperability with external systems.The evaluation and operational behavior of the new module was tested through a set of data transfer experiments over a wide area network environment. These experiments were performed to ensure that the changes in the system\\u2019s architecture did not affected its performance.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-166740\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xi,83\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2015:29\", \"keyword\": \"parallel file systems; distributed file systems; IKAROS file system; elastic-transfer; grid computing; storage systems; I/O limitations; exascale; low power consumption; low cost devices; synchronous; blocking; asynchronous; non-blocking; event-driven; JSON.; parallella filsystem; distribuerade filsystem; IKAROS filsystem; elastic-transfer; grid computing; lagringssystem; I/O-begr\\u00e4nsningar; exa-skala; l\\u00e5g energif\\u00f6rbrukning; l\\u00e5gkostnadsenheter; synkron; blockerande; asynkron; icke-blockerande; h\\u00e4ndelsedriven; JSON\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-05-21T13:04:44.126+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-05-14T22:31:02.975+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T14:23:24.922+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-166740\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 94.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:454040\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2011]]}, \"title\": \"Database syncrhonization between devices : A new synchronization protocol for SQLite databases\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Long\", \"given\": \"Shitian\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": null, \"abstract\": \"Today people have multiple personal computers, personal digital assistants and smart phones.

Additionally, the device may have various input and output devices, thus leading to people utilizing different devices for different use cases. In order to provide the latest information to the users via any of their devices, data synchronization becomes a requirement for users.\\nThere are many data synchronization solutions for synchronizing database records and files. In the current database synchronization solutions, there is no clear source and target. For example, consider the case where a PDA synchronizes with a PC; the record could have been edited (changed) on both the PDA and PC. In this case it is not clear which should be synchronized with what should be the source for the value. In contrast, a files synchronization system has a clearly specified synchronizatiom sourse and destination structure. In this case the client Synchronizes their files with that of the server. In a version control system the client synchronize files with a repository acting as a version control server. There are many synchronizing protocols and each has been designed for different purpose. Protocols for synchronizing database records often provide continuous synchronization, leading to a lot of data being exchanging during the synchronization process, as a result the synchronization process takes a longer period of time, but maintains the semantics of the database updates (either a complete transaction completes or it must be rolled back). On the other hand, protocols for synchronizing files may require a short synchronization time, as the whole file transferred and replaces the previous version of the file at the destination. Note file synchronization may also transfer only the differences between the files, with a local transformation of an existing file copy of the by applying these differences as updates to the files. Sending only the updates to a file enables large files with a small number of changes to be quickly updated. However, file based updated does not efficiently support record level updates of a database.\\nIn this thesis we designed a new synchronization protocol for synchronizing two SQLite databases. This synchronization protocol borrows from (and hence offers the advantages of) a version control system in order to rapidly perform SQLite database synchronization. Moreover, this solution brings SQLite database additional functions, for example supporting multiple-user, transaction logs, and data roll-back.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-46712\", \"number-of-pages\": \"75\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"88\", \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-11-04T13:00:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-11-04T12:59:13.742+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T20:40:26.744+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-46712\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 75.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:456523\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2011]]}, \"title\": \"Decentralized Authentication in OpenStack Nova : Integration of OpenID\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Khan\", \"given\": \"Rasib Hassan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The evolution of cloud computing is driving the next generation of internet services.

Usually, there are several emitters transmitting radar pulses at the same time in an environment.

The selected approach analyzes batches of pulses in parallel to exploit the advantages of a multi-threaded\\u00a0Central Processing Unit (CPU) or a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).\\u00a0Firstly, a suitable clustering algorithm had to be selected. Secondly, an optimal batch size had to be determined to achieve high clustering performance and to rapidly process the batches of pulses in parallel. A quantitative method based on experiments was used to measure clustering performance, execution time, system response, and parallelism as a function of batch sizes when using the selected clustering algorithm.The algorithm selected for clustering the data was Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)\\u00a0because of its advantages, such as not having to specify the number of clusters in advance, its ability to find arbitrary shapes of a cluster in a data set, and its low time complexity. The evaluation showed that implementing parallel batch processing is possible while still achieving high clustering performance, compared to a sequential implementation that used the maximum likelihood method.An optimal batch size in terms of data points and cutoff time is hard to determine since the batch size is very dependent on the input data. Therefore, one batch size might not be optimal in terms of clustering performance and system response for all streams of data. A solution could be to determine optimal batch sizes in advance for different streams of data, then adapt a batch size depending on the stream of data.However, with a high level of parallelism, an additional delay is introduced that depends on the difference between the time it takes to collect data points into a batch and the time it takes to process the batch, thus the system will be slower to output its result for a given batch compared to a sequential system. For a time-critical system, a high level of parallelism might be unsuitable since it leads to slower response times.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-273737\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xvi,57\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2020:178\", \"keyword\": \"Cluster analysis; DBSCAN; Parallelization; Signal Separation; Unsupervised learning; Klusteranalys; DBSCAN; Parallellisering; Signal Separation; O\\u00f6vervakat l\\u00e4rande\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2020-05-27T08:23:46.917+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2020-05-26T15:37:31.458+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T10:27:29.666+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-273737\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 73.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1692911\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2022]]}, \"title\": \"Deriving an Natural Language Processing inference Cost Model with Greenhouse Gas Accounting : Towards a sustainable usage of Machine Learning\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Axberg\", \"given\": \"Tom\", \"localId\": \"u1jnfm8d\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879223\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r elektroteknik och datavetenskap (EECS)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Gindele\", \"given\": \"Oliver\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Datatonic\"}]}, {\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"882650\", \"name\": \"KTH, Datavetenskap\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The interest in using State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Pre-Trained Language Model (PLM) in product development is growing.

Selecting the Natural Language Processing (NLP) model with the highest accuracy is the usual way of deciding which PLM to use.

By constructing this cost model and testing it against real-life examples, essential information about a given NLP implementation and the relationship between monetary and environmental costs will be derived.The literature studies reveal that the derival of a cost model is a complex area, and the results confirm that it is not a straightforward procedure to approximate energy costs.

A signal analyzer has also been developed in order to present the B-ISDN message in a hierarchical structure, which greatly reduced the difficulty of reading the B-ISDN message in the binary level. Furthermore, the user is given such a possibility of building own signal sequences and associating the outgoing and incoming message in a logical way, it is easy to study each response message with its initial message. Both outgoing and incoming messages/sequences can be saved in secondary memory in form of an ASCII file and can be reloaded later for analyzing the signals.This thesis describes the background of this project and the design and implementation process of the signal generator.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-99148\", \"number-of-pages\": \"65\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-07-30T13:55:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-07-14T15:14:19.422+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T03:58:20.474+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-99148\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 65.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:785081\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2015]]}, \"title\": \"Design and implementation of LTE-A and 5G kernel algorithms on SIMD vector processor\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Guo\", \"given\": \"Jiabing\", \"localId\": \"u1enawiw\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Liu\", \"given\": \"Dake\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"BIT China\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"With the wide spread of wireless technology, the time for 4G has arrived, and 5G will appear not so far in the future. However, no matter whether it is 4G or 5G, low latency is a mandatory requirement for baseband processing at base stations for modern cellular standards. In particular, in a future 5G wireless system, with massive MIMO and ultra-dense cells, the demand for low round trip latency between the mobile device and the base station requires a baseband processing delay of 1 ms. This is 10 percentage of today\\u2019s LTE-A round trip latency, while at the same time massive MIMO requires large-scale matrix computations. This is especially true for channel estimation and MIMO detection at the base station. Therefore, it is essential to ensure low latency for the user data traffic.In this master\\u2019s thesis, LTE/LTE-A uplink physical layer processing is examined, especially the process of channel estimation and MIMO detection. In order to analyze this processing we compare two conventional algorithms\\u2019 performance and complexity for channel estimation and MIMO detection. The key aspect which affects the algorithms\\u2019 speed is identified as the need for \\u201cmassive complex matrix inversion\\u201d. A parallel coding scheme is proposed to implement a matrix inversion kernel algorithm on a single instruction multiple data stream (SIMD) vector processor.The major contribution of this thesis is implementation and evaluation of a parallel massive complex matrix inversion algorithm.

IMS is standardized by the 3GPP standardization forum, and was first released in 2002. Since then IMS has not had the wide adoption by operators as first anticipated. As 3G already supported voice and video, the operators could not justify the expense of IMS.The current emergence of the fourth generation mobile communication system named Long Term Evolution (LTE) has, however, increased the need for knowledge of IMS and of creating services for it. LTE networks are IP only networks that provide low latency. In order to use LTE for making phone calls, VoIP technologies are needed. IMS is the architecture intended to be used for Voice over LTE (VoLTE).The need for tools for education within IMS was seen in 2006 by Enea Experts in Link\\u00f6ping, Sweden. The author of this thesis designed an IMS for educational purposes, but the project was never fully completed.This thesis will reexamine the design decisions previously made by the author. The requirements stated by the customer remain: that an IMS with basic signaling and logging should be easy to install, maintain, and evolve at a low cost. A literature study of IMS and VoLTE is presented to contribute with knowledge in these areas. The previous design and implementation made by the author is presented and analyzed. The third-party software that the previous implementation was based on is reexamined. Existing open source components are analyzed in order to identify how they can be used to solve the problem and to identify what remains to be developed in order to fulfill the requirements. New design suggestions, presented in today\\u00b4s context, are proposed and verified using analytical reasoning and experiments.The outcome of the final work is new verified design decisions for the customer to use when implementing a new IMS for educational purposes.

While international roaming technically works with GSM, the cost of phone calls from one country to another are often much higher than calls within a country. Despite political pressure to reduce the costs of roaming within the European Union, the cost of phone calls from one country to another are often quite expensive. A cost-saving solution is eagerly desired by many firms. OptiCall Solutions AB has designed an integrated system called the Dial over Data (DoD) solution. In this scheme, a caller sends a data request to the DoD server instead of directly making a call to the party that they wish to speak with. The DoD solution uses an Internet Protocol Private Branch Exchange (IP-PBX) to make two Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) calls, one to the caller and another to the callee, then bridges these two calls. To realize cost savings, the cost of these two calls and the cost of the infrastructure necessary to make the two calls and to bridge them must be lower than the cost of the direct call.\\nCall Through is a service for making cheap international calls which is provided by many telecommunications companies. Instead of making a direct call to the party the caller wants to speak with, the caller makes a call to the local call-through service access number. The caller dials the actual callee\\u2019s number after the call is established. The service provider then makes a call to the callee and bridges the two calls. The caller only needs to pay for a local call and the service subscription fee, rather than the expensive international call fee. This can greatly reduce the costs for user who need to make a lot international calls. Today, many companies use such a call-through service in order to reduce the total cost of their employees\\u2019 calls.\\nAdditionally, the Mobile Extension (MEX) is a concept which gives mobile users the ability to use their mobile phone in the same manner as their fixed office phone, for example, by providing services such as setting presence and transferring a call. In addition, the user should experience a consistent interface, for example the calling number displayed for the callee should always be a number that the callee could use to return the call.\\nIn this thesis project, a mobile extension application called \\u2018OptiCaller\\u2019 based on the Symbian OS was developed and evaluated. This application is part of the DoD solution and provides client side functionality. Furthermore, it supports making call-through calls and using the MEX functions. Additionally, it is designed and implemented in a flexible way so that it can work with a variety of different PBX solutions.\\nA provisioning system called \\u2018OptiCaller Provisioning System\\u2019 was also designed and evaluated.

Personal information technology appliances have become part of our life, via cellular phones, PDAs, Bluetooth headsets, handheld keyboards, GPS, and digital cameras. In the future, new intelligent devices will be invented as technology evolves. However, because multiple devices provide similar (but different) functionality it is complex for the average user to choose a single device. Moreover, today it is hard to configure, administer, and use several different appliances together. In order to be utilized in an effective manner and in an accessible way, personal devices should be aggregated, i.e., connected together via a local area network so that they can appear to the user as if they were a single device.\\nThis paper introduces a connection model based on device aggregation to realize shared state, the behavior of a shared appliance, and with the superset of the individual device functionality. Such an aggregated logical device might even exhibit functions which a user would have a very hard time realizing by manually combining devices. This will facilitate the user\\u2019s control over their appliances (build of different devices), but acting as one device.\\nThe project was a joint effort with David Sabat\\u00e9 Mogica.

Service discovery between two computers has been implemented using a custom program developed for a PDA. However, at present the PDA only sends a DA request packet with DHCP. However, service discovery has been successfully tested between two computers.

This has proved to be a boon to callers who can reach the other party directly via the Internet. Unfortunately numerous business persons still need to call to and from mobile phones which are currently a domain where the customers are generally tightly bound to their operators.\\nTo provide a simple solution to this problem for companies, Opticall AB has designed an integrated system called the Dial over Data solution, coupling a mobile interface with a low-rate communication channel, which allows calls to be originated remotely at the best price, exploiting the customer company's existing network. This scheme allows the customer company to easily control telecommunications costs, to monitor their employees' efficiency, and more generally speaking to claim a central role in the communications of their employees. The proposed solution allows distant callers (usually employees of the customer company) to benefit from the company's internal network, which is usually more cost effective and offering connectivity to more networks than a cell phone. The Dial over Data solution enables communication between any phone accessible from the customer company's telephony network (such as SIP clients, landline phones, and mobile phones) at a lower cost.&lt;/p&gt; This thesis project analyzes existing technologies and compares them to the pre-existing prototype to ascertain the validity of the method and of the components used.

A successful DDoS attack that manages to penetrate a company\\u2019s network can lead to devastating damages in the form of lost income, reduced productivity, increase in costs, and damage to the company\\u2019s image and reputation.The different DDoS attacks are many and of different character and often Offer different parts of the network, which makes it very difficult to defend against. It is also very clear that DDoS attacks are increasing in both numbers and size every year. From our experiments we have proven that anyone with little knowledge and limited resources can perform DDoS attacks that will make a website unavailable. This fact should cause companies that base their business on the internet, aware that they are likely to someday be subject to a DDoS attack.From our research we have found a variety of different DDoS solutions on the market that promise to offer protection. Many of which claim to protect against all different types of DDoS attacks. In practice it is impossible to find something that guarantees 100% safety. According to earlier research in the field, there are many different ways of protecting a network against DDoS attacks, e.g. via Software Defined Networking, Hop-Count Filtering, or Kill-bots.Our own tests show that a virtual firewall can offer protection against DDoS attacks on a low scale, but that such a solution has a number of weaknesses. If the firewall does protect the website, the attacker could instead shift to attacking the firewall itself.Our research also shows that the most common motives behind DDoS attacks are criminal purposes. Criminals use DDoS attacks to earn money by offering directed DDoS attacks against websites or by trying to blackmail companies into paying a fee for not being attacked.We have also seen that the economic consequence of DDoS attacks are devastating if not handled with a sufficiently fast response. After investigating the e-commerce company CDON.com we learned that they could potentially lose roughly 36 410 SEK per minute when a DDoS attack is underway against them.In today\\u2019s business climate it is important for companies to be able to rely on the internet for their activity and for customers to have easy access to the company\\u2019s products and services.

Tools such as TITANSim are used to develop the test framework upon which a load test application is created. These tools need to be highly efficient and optimized to reduce the cost of the system test. This thesis project created a load test application based on the distributed scheduling architecture of TITANSim, whereby multiple users can be simulated using a single test component. This new distributed scheduling system greatly reduces the number of operating system processes involved, thus reducing the memory consumption of the load test application; hence higher loads can be easily simulated with limited hardware resources.The load test application used for system test of the HSS is based on the central scheduling architecture of TITANSim. The central scheduling architecture is a <i>function test </i>concept, where every user is simulated by a single test component. In the <i>system test </i>several thousand users are simulated by the test system. Therefore, the load application based on central scheduling architecture uses thousands of test components leading to high memory consumption in the test system. In this architecture, the scheduling of test components is centralized which results in a lot of communication overhead within the test system, as thousands of test components communicate with a <i>master scheduling </i>component during the test execution.On the other hand, in the distributed scheduling architecture the scheduling task is performed locally <i>by each test component. There is no communication overhead within the test system. </i>Therefore, the test system is highly efficient. In the distributed scheduling architecture the traffic flow of the simulated users are described using the Finite State Machines (FSMs). The FSMs are specified in the configuration files that are used by the test system at run time. Therefore, implementing traffic cases using the distributed scheduling architecture becomes simpler and faster as there is no (TTCN-3) coding/compilation.The HSS is the only node (within Ericsson) whose system test is performed using the central scheduling architecture of TITANSim. The other users (nodes) of TITANSim are using the distributed scheduling architecture for its apparent benefits. Under this circumstance, this thesis project assumes significance for the HSS. When a decision to adapt the distributed scheduling architecture is made for the system test of the HSS, the load application created in this thesis project can be used as a model, or extended for the migration of the test modules for the HSS from the central scheduling architecture to the distributed scheduling architecture.By creating this load application we have gained significant knowledge of the TITANSim framework; most importantly, the necessary modifications to the TITANSim framework required to create a distributed scheduling architecture based load application for the HSS. The load application created for this project was used to (system) test the HSS by generating load using real system test hardware. The results were analytically compared with the test results from the existing load application (which is based on the central scheduling architecture).

Moreover context information may be produced in different devices connected to different networks. These difficulties have limited the development of context-aware applications. This thesis presents a context distribution method exploiting the event notification mechanisms of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), aiming to provide access to context information regardless of where it is produced.\\nThe context distribution component presented in this thesis uses SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE) to enable context sharing by using a SIP presence server, specifically the SIP Express Router (SER) and its presence module. This context distribution component allows distribution of context information in both synchronous and asynchronous mode. The distribution mode depends on the application requirements for context distribution, as well as the nature and characteristics of the contextinformation. In this thesis, based on system scalability, the user\\u2019s mobility, and latency - recommendations are given about in which situations each mode is more suitable for distributing context information.\\nThe system was evaluated using a load generator. The evaluation revealed that the server is highly scalable. The response time for synchronous retrieval of context information is nearly constant, while in asynchronous mode the time to process a subscription increases with the amount of information in the database regarding previous subscriptions. Notifications are sent at a regular rate (\\u22482800 notifications per second); however there is a purposely random delay (0 to 1 second), between an update of context information (i.e. receipt of a publish message) and the start of notifications to subscribed users.\\nThe requirements of the context-aware applications using the distribution component, such as response time, have to be taken into account when deciding upon the mode of context distribution for each application. This thesis provides some empirical data to help an application developer make this selection.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91854\", \"number-of-pages\": \"93\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2008-12\", \"keyword\": \"Context-awareness; Context Information Distribution; SIP; SIMPLE\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-21T12:45:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-21T12:42:40.926+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:16:54.365+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91854\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 93.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:602353\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2013]]}, \"title\": \"DNS prestanda\", \"language\": \"swe\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Bentahar\", \"given\": \"Younes\", \"localId\": \"u16iz6av\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Use of computers and computer networks is nowadays a part of everyday life. You do not use them only at home when you sit at you computer, but you can use them all the time everywhere. This can involve everything from surf to any website when you are at home, to checking your email on your mobile when you are on your way to work. Most people do not think about how it really works when they try to access a web page by typing the address into their browser, but something that most people probably notice is how long it can sometimes take to access a web page.All items which are directly connected to the IP network have a unique IP address that is used to make it possible to communicate. The IP address is either a period separated sequence of digits representing 32 bits or a colon separated sequence of digits representing 128 bits, depending on whether the address is an IPv4 or IPv6 address. Such numeric sequences are often difficult for us humans to remember therefore, the domain name system (DNS) was constructed. DNS makes it possible for us to write addresses in a textual format to access an item stored in a device connected to the network. DNS can be seen as a directory for the network and can be compared to a telephone directory, where if you know the name of a person can find his or her phone number.This thesis will describe how the various address translations are done by using DNS. It will also examine how much impact DNS has on the experienced delay from the time you type a web page address in the address bar of your browser to the actual time you reach the website. A survey of DNS performance will be presented to investigate how much delay can be reduced by using one of Sweden's two most well-known public DNS servers (Google Public DNS and OpenDNS) instead of the normal default DNS server provided by one's Internet service provider (ISP).The survey will also show how the DNS lookup waiting time changes at different times of day and different days of the week. The purpose of this work is to provide a basic explanation of what DNS is and increase the understanding of how an everyday user in a simple way can make their network usage more effective by getting their DNS lookups to occur faster.The conclusion from this thesis is that the alternative DNS server, Google Public DNS has the fastest DNS lookup time for this particular computer which the measurement was carried on. But this tells us nothing about whether the case for any other network users because the observed DNS performance has a large extent dependent on the ISP you are connected to, and what place you are at.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-117626\", \"number-of-pages\": \"24\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:2\", \"keyword\": \"DNS; DNSSEC; performance; measurements; Google Public DNS; OpenDNS; DNS; DNSSEC; prestanda; m\\u00e4tningar; Google Public DNS; OpenDNS\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-02-01T13:08:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-02-01T08:15:27.720+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T01:20:43.055+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-117626\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 24.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:524298\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"DNS Traffic Analysis for Network-based Malware Detection\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Vu Hong\", \"given\": \"Linh\", \"localId\": \"u1z96o6j\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Liljenstam\", \"given\": \"Michael\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Security Research\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Probst\", \"given\": \"Christian W.\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Technical University of Denmark (DTU)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Botnets are generally recognized as one of the most challenging threats on the Internet today. Botnets have been involved in many attacks targeting multinational organizations and even nationwide internet services. As more effective detection and mitigation approaches are proposed by security researchers, botnet developers are employing new techniques for evasion. It is not surprising that the Domain Name System (DNS) is abused by botnets for the purposes of evasion, because of the important role of DNS in the operation of the Internet. DNS provides a flexible mapping between domain names and IP addresses, thus botnets can exploit this dynamic mapping to mask the location of botnet controllers. Domain-flux and fast-flux (also known as IP-flux) are two emerging techniques which aim at exhausting the tracking and blacklisting effort of botnet defenders by rapidly changing the domain names or their associated IP addresses that are used by the botnet. In this thesis, we employ passive DNS analysis to develop an anomaly-based technique for detecting the presence of a domain-flux or fast- flux botnet in a network. To do this, we construct a lookup graph and a failure graph from captured DNS traffic and decompose these graphs into clusters which have a strong correlation between their domains, hosts, and IP addresses. DNS related features are extracted for each cluster and used as input to a classication module to identify the presence of a domain-flux or fast-flux botnet in the network. The experimental evaluation on captured traffic traces veried that the proposed technique successfully detected domain-flux botnets in the traces. The proposed technique complements other techniques for detecting botnets through traffic analysis.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93842\", \"number-of-pages\": \"67\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:53\", \"keyword\": \"DNS analysis; domain-flux; fast-flux; network-based malware detection; intrusion detection\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-05-04T08:04:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-30T18:42:03.806+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:45:05.409+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93842\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 67.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511400\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2008]]}, \"title\": \"Drift\\u00f6vervakning av Windows och Linux/Unix Servrar\", \"language\": \"swe\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Falk\", \"given\": \"Mikael\", \"localId\": \"u1ek693s\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Fernandez Karlsson\", \"given\": \"Matias\", \"localId\": \"u1xru1nu\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Ju fler servrar, med olika konfigurationer och olika system, som blir medlemmar i ett n\\u00e4tverk, desto sv\\u00e5rare och osmidigare blir det att \\u00f6vervaka n\\u00e4tverksmilj\\u00f6n.

Parking has been considered as a subsidiary activity to owning a car. However, these days owning a car has become the norm, which leads to a greater demand for parking. Unregulated parking demand often leads to increased traffic congestion, when there are not enough parking spaces to keep up with the demand. Congestion itself has a negative impact on the environment and causes safety issues. A common solution to reduce congestion have been by influencing the demand for parking spaces through parking prices. During recent years, the existing pricing strategies have not been able to keep up with the daily changes in demand. Therefore, stakeholders in the parking industry have started to shift towards working for dynamic pricing.Dynamic pricing utilizes a pricing strategy that sets the price according to the current demand and occupancy. However, the parking industry is missing a key feature to fully enable dynamic pricing. There is no communication standard in the parking industry. Thus, there is no efficient communication mean for the stakeholders to share their parking-related information (such as location, occupancy, and tariff data). This thesis has developed and proposes a protocol for sharing such parking-related information. The aim is that the protocol will be used as a communication standard in the parking industry. Due to limited time, the most focus was put on completing the protocol for tariff data. However, the developed protocol can be considered as a partial solution towards dynamic pricing. Because the protocol can still be used to properly share tariff data.Based on the evaluation, the protocol could express a variety of tariffs. The tariffs that are expressible have use cases such as early bird, residential, or on-street parking. To make integration easier, for the parking industry, the protocol includes tools to aid integrations of the protocol. A future work will be to complete the support of location and occupancy related data. Additionally, it has been discussed that the protocol will onwards be developed as open-source.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-229904\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,75\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2018:127\", \"keyword\": \"Data sharing; Dynamic pricing; Parking industry; Parking tariffs; Protocol; Datakommunikation; Dynamisk priss\\u00e4ttning; Parkeringsindustrin; Parkeringstariffer; Protokoll\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-06-12T09:03:20.606+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-06-08T12:53:09.971+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T20:44:25.576+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-229904\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 88.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:699823\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2014]]}, \"title\": \"Dynamic scaling of a web-based application in a Cloud Architecture\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Hossain\", \"given\": \"Md.

These unpredictable natures of the traffic have led to many new and unique challenges which must be addressed by solution architects, application developers, and technology researchers. All of these actors must continually innovate to create new attractive application and new system architectures to support the users of these new applications. In addition, increased traffic increases the demands for resources, while users demand even faster response times, despite the ever-growing datasets underlying many of these new applications.

This thesis project has been done at Scania IT using their implementation of Dynamics AX.This thesis project consists of an extensive literature study regarding both ERP Systems as well as other systems in regards to the cloud. It was decided early on to focus on the new version of Dynamics AX, which currently is only available in the cloud and compare this implementation to the two versions that the majority are using today, AX 2009 and AX 2012. The benefits of AX and Azure both being Microsoft products are clear with the welldesigned integrations and support all the way through the clients to the servers regarding backups and load balancing. It is shown how the developers have to work differently in regards to integrations with outside systems, especially in regards to AX 2009 with the frameworks having changed. The addition of Data Entities mean that the developers can save a lot of time by only needing a reference to the location of the object in the database instead of having to keep track of all the tables themselves.The analysis focuses on the differences in four different areas, performance &amp; accessibility, scalability, cost savings as well as security &amp; privacy. The background knowledge that is being used for the analysis primarily comes from the literature study as well as knowledge gained by studying the implementation at Scania today. The result shows that there are clear advantages regarding performance, cost savings and especially accessibility, however it is also clear that laws in a lot of countries still have not caught up with the fact that it is possible to use the cloud for data storage these days. Which in turn means that the best move in the near future for the majority of ERP users would be either a hybrid or private cloud within the borders of the same country.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-196060\", \"number-of-pages\": \"56\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2016:145\", \"keyword\": \"Dynamics AX; Microsoft; ERP; Enterprise resource planning; Azure; Cloud; Dynamics AX; Microsoft; ERP; Enterprise Resource Planning; Azure; Molnet\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2016-11-11T10:08:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2016-11-11T10:08:24.757+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-27T04:44:29.499+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-196060\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 56.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:534662\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1996]]}, \"title\": \"E13 Mux : Study and prototyping\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Jonsson\", \"given\": \"Jonas\", \"localId\": \"u1k0u40y\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Strangert\", \"given\": \"Thomas\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Telecom AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Even though this thesis-project never reached the goal, a fully equipped and working prototype, it is possible to make a few important and valuable conclusions for further implementation of a prototype handling multiplexing and demultiplexing of timeslots in primary rate, E1 level and third rate, E3 level.\\nThis `stripped' prototype is designed to multiplex timeslots from two E1 links into one E3 link, demultiplex timeslots from one E3 link into to two E1 links, also detect and generate basic alarms such as AIS, RAI and Loss of Signal. It is equipped with one dualdirected E3 interface and a dualdirected interface for two DL-2 connections. DL-2 is an Ericsson internal format. A conversion from DL-2 to E1 is made on the board. Since there are only two actual DL-2 connections and the remaining fourteen connections simulates AIS when multiplexed and not taken care of when demultiplexed, the prototype is considered as `stripped'. The wired prototype is easily controlled from an ANSI terminal, through the V.24 interface. When prototyping is finished and the construction is installed in AXE-10 environment, the V.24 interface will be unnecessary. The reason is the command interpreter that the V.24 interface is built upon. A command interpreter is not needed in AXE-10 environment, since the multiplexer unit will be controlled by DEVCB-signals from a regional processor and not by user commands.\\nThe hardware is built up around the Motorola 68HC11F1. The multiplexors are very simple and are controlled by pins and not registers. This makes them easy to integrate in a system, but on the other hand it calls for higher performance of the device processor. The 68HC11F1 is not suitable for a fully equipped construction. The device processor must be able to handle alarms and produce statistics from a total of seventeen links, because the multiplexors doesn't support much more than a few alarm functions.\\nThe software is written with processes and signals using OS11 operative system. The software is mostly written in C. The tasks that the processes preforms are distinct and logically separated, and will not be a cause of concern when reading the programs. Redesign of one process' functionality will have no or moderate impact on other processes, since the processes communicates through well defined signals.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98048\", \"number-of-pages\": null, \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-18T14:36:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-18T12:46:55.955+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:11:33.774+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98048\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 0.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:508237\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2010]]}, \"title\": \"Economical and Political Implications of DNSSEC Deployment\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Eldh\", \"given\": \"Axel Fant\", \"localId\": \"u1hdxu4x\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Kirvesniemi\", \"given\": \"Mattias\", \"localId\": \"u1p1p853\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This report provides a summary of the current deployment of Domain Name System (DNS) Security Extensions (DNSSEC) as well as a discussion of future deployments and deployment rates. It analyses the problems that have occurred and considers those that may arise. This thesis focuses mainly on economical and political perspectives, rather than the technical perspective used in most reports regarding this subject.\\nThere were four areas that needed to be examined: the technical basis for DNSSEC, the deployment process, the current level of DNSSEC deployment, and the opinions regarding this subject. The information about the deployment process was obtained mainly through articles, but also through reports from organizations such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and the Electronic Privacy Information Centre. To acquire up to date data on DNSSEC deployment, SecSpider was used to research the level of deployment as of 2010-05-06. The search was restricted to the generic Top Level Domains (gTLDs) and country code TLDs (ccTLDs) of the top 20 countries in terms of Internet usage as well as the OECD countries. This restriction was made to narrow down the scope to the TLDs where DNSSEC would have the greatest impact. The \\u201cTop 20\\u201d comprises 77.27 % of the world\\u2019s Internet users, hence it is where DNSSEC deployment would affect the most people. The OECD is in this thesis considered a sufficient ly large selection to represent themost technologically advanced and economically powerful countries in the world regardless of size. Major powers such as China, India, and Russia while not included in the OECD are represented in the \\u201cTop 20\\u201d due to their size.\\nOur results show that some major TLDs have implemented DNSSEC and that the rate of deployment has increased in the last few years. However, the level of DNSSEC deployment in the TLDs is still rather low; 15.00 % in the gTLDs and ccTLDs of the Top 20 countries in Internet usage, and 20.00 % in the OECD\\u2019s ccTLDs. Deployment in the root is ongoing during spring 2010, this could have a great impact on the rate of deployment as deployment in a gTLD or ccTLD is highly dependent on deployment high up in the hierarchy due to the nature of DNSSEC. It is unlikely that corporations would implement DNSSEC without a potential return on investment (ROI) and management control measures from governments might be required to increase deployment pace at the lower levels of the DNS hierarchy.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91103\", \"number-of-pages\": \"24\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"108\", \"keyword\": \"IPv6; Multicast; Proxying; Tunneling; Routing\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-08T09:42:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-07T16:30:55.466+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:30:22.794+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91103\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 24.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1597882\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2021]]}, \"title\": \"Efficient generation and rendering of tube geometry in Unreal Engine : Utilizing compute shaders for 3D line generation\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Woxler\", \"given\": \"Platon\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879223\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r elektroteknik och datavetenskap (EECS)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Lane\", \"given\": \"H\\u00e5kan\", \"localId\": \"u1xewqw3\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879223\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r elektroteknik och datavetenskap (EECS)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Massive graph visualization in an immersive environment, such as virtual reality (VR) or Augmented Reality (AR), has the possibility to improve users\\u2019 understanding when exploring data in new ways. To make the most of a visualization, such as this, requires interactive components that are fast enough to accommodate interactivity. By rendering the edges of the graph as shaded lines that imitate three\\u2011dimensional (3D) lines or tubes, one can circumvent technical limitations. This method works well enough when using traditional two\\u2011dimensional (2D) monitors, but representing tubes as flat lines in a virtual environment (VE) makes for a less immersive user experience as opposed to visualizing true 3D geometry. In order to accommodate for these requirements i.e., speed and visual fidelity, we need a time efficient way of producing tubular meshes. This thesis project explores how one can generate tubular geometry utilizing compute shaders in the modern game engine, Unreal Engine (UE). Exploiting the parallel computing power of the graphical processing unit (GPU) we use compute shaders to generate a tubular mesh following a predetermined path. The result from the project is an open source plugin for UE, able to generate tubular geometry at rapid rates. While not giving any major advantages when generating smaller models, comparing it to a sequential implementation, the compute shader implementation create and render models &gt; 40\\u00d7 faster when generating 10<sup>6</sup> tube segments. A secondary effect of generating most of the data on the GPU, is that we avoid bottlenecks that can occur when surpassing the bandwidth of the central processing unit (CPU) to GPU data transfer. Using this tool researches can more easily explore information visualization in a VE. Furthermore, this thesis promotes extended development of mesh generation, using compute shaders in UE.\\u00a0\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-302564\", \"number-of-pages\": \"73\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2021:500\", \"keyword\": \"Computer Graphics; Mesh Models; General-Purpose Computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU); Datorgrafik; Mesh-modeller; Ber\\u00e4kningar p\\u00e5 Grafikprocessorer f\\u00f6r Generella Anv\\u00e4ndningsomr\\u00e5den\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2021-09-29T08:50:57.562+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2021-09-28T09:23:11.716+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-25T10:48:31.976+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-302564\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 73.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:734631\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2014]]}, \"title\": \"Efficient Privacy Preserving Key Management for Public Cloud Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Kathirvel\", \"given\": \"Anitha\", \"localId\": \"u18o3si8\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Madan\", \"given\": \"Siddharth\", \"localId\": \"u14md5jb\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Most applications and documents are stored in a public cloud for storage and management purposes in a cloud computing environment. The major advantages of storing applications and documents in public cloud are lower cost through use of shared computing resources and no upfront infrastructure costs. However, in this case the management of data and other services is insecure. Therefore, security is a major problem in a public cloud as the cloud and the network are open to many other users. In order to provide security, it is necessary for data owners to store their data in the public cloud in a secure way and to use an appropriate access control scheme.Designing a computation and communication efficient key management scheme to selectively share documents based on fine-grained attribute-based access control policies in a public cloud is a challenging task. There are many existing approaches that encrypt documents prior to storage in the public cloud: These approaches use different keys and a public key cryptographic system to implement attribute-based encryption and/or proxy re-encryption. However, these approaches do not efficiently handle users joining and leaving the system when identity attributes and policies change. Moreover, these approaches require keeping multiple encrypted copies of the same documents, which has a high computational cost or incurs unnecessary storage costs. Therefore, this project focused on the design and development of an efficient key management scheme to allow the data owner to store data in a cloud service in a secure way. Additionally, the proposed approach enables cloud users to access the data stored in a cloud in a secure way.Many researchers have proposed key management schemes for wired and wireless networks. All of these existing key management schemes differ from the key management schemes proposed in this thesis. First, the key management scheme proposed in this thesis increases access level security. Second, the proposed key management scheme minimizes the computational complexity of the cloud users by performing only one mathematical operation to find the new group key that was computed earlier by the data owner. In addition, this proposed key management scheme is suitable for a cloud network. Third, the proposed key distribution and key management scheme utilizes privacy preserving methods, thus preserving the privacy of the user. Finally, a batch key updating algorithm (also called batch rekeying) has been proposed to reduce the number of rekeying operations required for performing batch leave or join operations. The key management scheme proposed in this thesis is designed to reduce the computation and communication complexity in all but a few cases, while increasing the security and privacy of the data.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-148048\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,57\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2014:107\", \"keyword\": \"Cloud storage; Secure Storage; Key Management scheme; access level security; Cloud Storage; s\\u00e4ker f\\u00f6rvaring; nyckelhantering schema; \\u00e5tkomstniv\\u00e5 s\\u00e4kerhet\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-08-05T15:51:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-07-18T17:58:09.896+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T19:18:04.969+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-148048\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 70.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:516963\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2000]]}, \"title\": \"Electronic payment and controlfunctions in the BESTYR project\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Karlsson\", \"given\": \"Ulrik\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Sundberg\", \"given\": \"Jonas\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Sweco VBB Viak\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This master thesis aims at developing to a demonstrate system for road-pricing.

In such heterogeneous networks, wireless local area networks (WLANs) are integrated with wireless wide area networks (WWANs), and there exist a tight interaction between them.The almost-ubiquitous support for IEEE802.11 WLANs (usually referred to as Wi-Fi\\u00ae) makes this radio access technology a potential integrated component of near-future mobile broadband. With Wi-Fi completely integrated into mobile access, MNOs would optimize user experience and use of resources by controlling device\\u2019s choice of connectivity. In addition to guaranteeing the best user experience, optimal use of access networks should care about energy-efficiency in order to extend device\\u2019s battery life.However, the performance of Wi-Fi is far from meet neither energy-efficiency nor quality of service (QoS) user\\u2019s requirements. This radio access technology employs an energy-consuming medium access control (MAC) protocol that wastes both bandwidth and device\\u2019s energy resources. Therefore, enhanced MAC protocols, cleverly combined with standardized power saving mechanisms such as automatic power save delivery (APSD), would improve both energy-efficiency and QoS in order to enhance WLANs performance and meet user\\u2019s expectations.In addition, current WLAN discovery mechanisms neither meet requirements of the integrated scenario. Handover operations must be improved in terms of energy efficiency and latency. Consequently, enhanced handover schemes should reduce overall device\\u2019s energy consumption during the process, and enable seamless handover between Wi-Fi APs and between cellular/Wi-Fi networks.During this thesis project, the main challenges of Wi-Fi towards its integration into mobile access broadband have been analyzed. Consequently, a solution has been designed in order to address the identified challenges, which have been introduced in the previous paragraphs. The solution consists of enhancements for IEEE 802.11 WLANs based on current standards that achieve energy-efficiency and QoS, and facilitate Wi-Fi/cellular networks interworking. Finally, a custom-designed simulator has been used to evaluate the proposed solution.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-142357\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xviii,97\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2014:16\", \"keyword\": \"energy-efficiency; WLAN; Wi-Fi; heterogeneous networks; seamless handover; network discovery; energieffektivitet; WLAN; Wi-Fi; avbrottsfri handover; n\\u00e4tverksidentifiering; heterogena n\\u00e4tverk\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-03-03T12:34:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-02-28T16:58:33.878+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T20:52:55.507+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-142357\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 115.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:608059\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2013]]}, \"title\": \"Energy-Efficient Vertical Handovers\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Rodr\\u00edguez Castillo\", \"given\": \"Jos\\u00e9 Mar\\u00eda\", \"localId\": \"u15zatv0\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Lundqvist\", \"given\": \"Henrik\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Recent studies have shown that there are currently more than 1.08 billion of Smartphones in the world, with around 89% of them used throughout the day. On average each of these users transfers more than 450 Mbytes per month via either a cellular network or a Wi-Fi network. So far it has been up to the user to decide which one of these two networks to use at each particular moment.In this master\\u2019s thesis, the potential energy savings that could be achieved by means of automating the choice of network interface are explored. This way, the user equipment itself would be able to initiate handovers from one radio access technology to another depending on each particular service and on the environmental conditions, and hence it could extend its battery life.The work has focused in energy efficient vertical handovers (VHOs) between Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and Wi-Fi networks. The rapid growth and increasing interest in LTE networks have been the main reasons why these networks have been chosen over Third Generation Mobile Networks. Nevertheless this work can be easily extended to other radio access technologies such as WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) or UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System).During the thesis project, the potential energy savings via VHOs depending on the type of service have been studied, as well as the different processes involved in a handover decision process. In order to do so, an energy consumption profile of each interface has been built, the different services have been modeled, and a heterogeneous scenario with Wi-Fi and LTE networks has been simulated. The thesis presents how these savings change within each service and with the environmental conditions (network load, interferences).The results show that large energy savings can be achieved. Nevertheless, the potential savings for each different user device can significantly differ. The VHO decision process includes two main aspects that need further study: investigating energy efficient ways of discovering accessible Wi-Fi access points and measuring the available throughput in each network at the moment of the decision.In addition, within LTE-Advanced and HetNets (Heterogeneous Networks), a lot of research regarding how LTE operators can offload traffic to smaller networks is being performed. These smaller networks consist basically of LTE micro cells and Wi-Fi. Both the energy savings and the potential energy expenses of offloading different kinds of traffic to a Wi-Fi network were also studied in this master\\u2019s thesis project, using the same approach described in the previous two paragraphs.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-118760\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xv, 111\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:33\", \"keyword\": \"Vertical Handover; Offload; LTE; 4G; WLAN; Wi-Fi; Energy consumption; Energy savings; Energy-efficient; Handover; IEEE 802.11; Vertikal Handover; Avlastning; LTE; 4G; WLAN; Wi-Fi; Energif\\u00f6rbrukning; Energibesparingar; Energieffektiv; IEEE 802.11; Smartphone; Batteriets livsl\\u00e4ngd\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-02-26T12:58:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-02-26T10:47:50.451+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T01:05:39.963+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-118760\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 126.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:531930\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1997]]}, \"title\": \"Enhanced hand-off scheme in Mobile IP network\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Rosenbaum\", \"given\": \"Filip\", \"localId\": \"u1yfjv7b\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}, {\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Rassoulpour\", \"given\": \"Arash\", \"localId\": \"u1plcs6g\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Seneviratne\", \"given\": \"Aruna\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"University of Technology, Sydney (UTS)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Motion across wireless cell boundaries causes increased delays and packet losses when the network routes the packet to the host's new location.

IoT provides the potential to combine machine-to-machine (M2M) interaction and real time data collection within the field of manufacturing. Therefore, the adoption of IoT in industry enhances dynamic optimization, control and data-driven decision making. However, the domain suffers due to interoperability issues, with massive numbers of IoT devices connecting to the internet despite the absence of communication standards upon. Heterogeneity is pervasive in IoT ranging from the low levels (device connectivity, network connectivity, communication protocols) to high levels (services, applications, and platforms). The project investigates the current state of industrial IoT (IIoT) ecosystem, to draw a comprehensive understanding on interoperability challenges and current solutions in supporting of IoT-based smart manufacturing.Based upon a literature review, IIoT interoperability issues were classified into four levels: technical, syntactical, semantic, and organizational level interoperability. Regarding each level of interoperability, the current solutions that addressing interoperability were grouped and analyzed. Nine reference architectures were compared in the context of supporting industrial interoperability. Based on the analysis, interoperability research trends and challenges were identified.FIWARE Generic Enablers (FIWARE GEs) were identified as a possible solution in supporting interoperability for manufacturing applications. FIWARE GEs were evaluated with a scenario-based Method for Evaluating Middleware Architectures (MEMS).\\u00a0 Nine key scenarios were identified in order to evaluate the interoperability attribute of FIWARE GEs. A smart manufacturing use case was prototyped and a test bed adopting FIWARE Orion Context Broker as its main component was designed.

The data rates provided to the customers by their network providers vary from Mbps to Gbps. However, rarely do users get the promised peak throughput.In cellular networks, network conditions change based on obstacles, weather conditions between the client and the base stations, and even the movement of objects and people. As a result of the changes in the radio link, the data transfer rate can change rapidly, hence devices needs to adjust their communications based on the currently available data rate.The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is widely used for reliable data transfer over networks. However, TCP was initially designed when link data rates were much lower than the link data rates commonly available today. As a result, TCP does not perform well at high data rates, despite some of the changes that have been made to the protocol to support high data rate links. Moreover, TCP has problems adapting to large changes in link bandwidth (not caused by congestion), resulting in a lower average throughput than the link could potentially deliver.This thesis evaluates two different versions of the TCP protocol (e.g., TCP Reno and Cubic TCP) and proposes a network coding scheme to enhance users\\u2019 experience when communicating over unstable radio links. The performance of the two TCP protocols and Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) scheme were measured in an emulated network environment.

How to disseminate content to people in a swift and fair way has long been a question. Choosing the right strategy for content distribution is especially crucial for mobile social networks. In this thesis project we use epidemic models for content distribution in mobile social networks.Stochastic mobility models and an SIR epidemic model are set up in the evaluation. We analyze the impact of various parameters of mobility models and epidemic model on content distribution\\u2019s success rate and delivery delay. Also, we exploit the social relationships to facilitate content distribution and show the impact of social relationships on content distribution.Simulations have shown that increasing speed and node number in the mobility models will have positive impact on content distribution success rate as well as decreasing the delay. The infect time limit and infect count limit of the epidemic model are also important for swiftly distributing content while considering energy consumption and fairness for nodes.In the social relationship simulation, nodes\\u2019 meeting times during a period of time are calculated and a threshold based on a certain level of meeting times is used for categorizing the friendship relationships between nodes. The results show that it will be easier for a successful distribution to be achieved as the social relationship between nodes gets stronger. Also, the delay shows a decreasing trend until reaching the ideal distribution delay time.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-118470\", \"number-of-pages\": \"60\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:31\", \"keyword\": \"content distribution; epidemic; social networks; inneh\\u00e5ll distribution; epidemi; sociala n\\u00e4tverk\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-02-19T11:31:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-02-19T11:18:01.088+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T01:09:28.297+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-118470\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 60.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:538043\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1995]]}, \"title\": \"Ethernet communication in a PC environment\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Jonsson Fresk\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"localId\": \"u1ex148n\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Karlsson\", \"given\": \"Per\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ortivus Medical AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The purpose of the examwork made at Ortivus Medical AB was to make a network module for the MIDA CoroNet system.

It is reliable and cost-effective and features error detection and fault confinement capabilities. CAN has been widely used in other applications, such as onboard trains, ships, construction vehicles, and aircraft. CAN has even been applied within the industrial automation segment in a range of devices such as programmable controllers, industrial robots, digital and analog I/O modules, sensors, etc. Despite its robustness and other positive features, the CAN bus has limitations in form of limited maximum data rate and maximum bus length. Also the CAN network topology is rigidly fixed which is a severe limiting factor in some of its application cases, therefore several industrial actors are evaluating alternatives to CAN.Ethernet is one of the potential candidates to replace CAN. It is a widespread and well knowntechnology, easily accessible, and many off-the-shelf solutions are available. It can support extended networks and offers wide possibilities in terms of network topology thanks to active switches. It features very high bandwidth, which has increased systematically from 10 Mbps to 100 Gbps year after year, always preserving backward compatibility to the maximum possible extent.The purpose of this thesis project is to investigate the possibility of replacing the CAN bus with Ethernet according to the following requirements:<ul><li>Standard off-the-shelf components and software stacks</li><li>No modification of the network node application software, i.e. messages formatted accordingto CAN protocols must be transferred by means of Ethernet.</li></ul>A main issue is that CAN is time deterministic; it is always possible to predict the maximum latency in a message transfer. On the other hand Ethernet is still considered unreliable for time-critical applications, although the advent of Ethernet switches has minimized this non-deterministic behavior.A unique approach to this issue is offered as a result of the work done by Time Critical Networks, a newly started Swedish company. Their tool makes it possible to calculate the maximum forwarding time of a frame in an Ethernet network. This tool may make it possible to validate the use of Ethernet for time-critical applications.CPAC Systems, a company in the Volvo group which develops and manufactures steer-by-wire systems based on the CAN technology, wishes to verify whether Ethernet could now be considered as a solution to complement or replace CAN, thus overcoming CAN\\u2019s limitations. This verification is the goal of this master thesis project.The work was carried out through three different phase:<ul><li>First we performed a theoretical evaluation by modeling the Ethernet network using Time Critical Network\\u2019s tools.</li><li>Next we verified the results by implementing the modeled CAN/Ethernet network that was previously modeled.</li><li>Finally, we validated the solution by directly testing the modeled CAN/Ethernet in combination with CPAC System\\u2019s steer-by-wire technology.</li></ul>The results obtained show that Ethernet in combination with Time Critical Network\\u2019s modeling tool, when it comes to time-determinism, can be a complement and/or an alternative to the CAN bus.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91049\", \"number-of-pages\": \"133\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"175\", \"keyword\": \"CANbus; CAN/Ethernet converter; Ethernet; real-time; steer-by-wire\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-07T08:35:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-06T16:57:19.464+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:31:49.317+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91049\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 133.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:617893\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2013]]}, \"title\": \"Evaluating a publish/subscribe proxy for HTTP\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Zhang\", \"given\": \"Yuanhui\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"With the increasingly high speed of the Internet and its wide spread usage, the current Internet architecture exhibits some problems.

In this thesis project a publish/subscribe network is built and then used in the design, implementation, and evaluation of a publish/subscribe proxy for today\\u2019s HTTP based communication. By using this proxy users are able to use their existing web browser to send both HTTP requests and Publish/Subscribe Internet Routing Paradigm (PSIRP) requests. A publish/subscribe overlay is responsible for maintaining PSIRP contents. The proxy enables web browser clients to benefit from the publish/subscribe network, without requiring them to change their behavior or even be aware of the fact that the content that they want to access is being provided via the publish/subscribe overlay. The use of the overlay enables a user\\u2019s request to be satisfied by any copy of the content, potentially decreasing latency, reducing backbone network traffic, and reducing the load on the original content server. One of the aims of this thesis is to make more PSIRP content available, this is done by introducing a proxy who handles both HTTP and PSIRP requests, but having received content as a result of an HTTP response it publishes this data as PSIRP accessible content. The purpose is to foster the introduction and spread of content based access.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-121282\", \"number-of-pages\": \"70\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:68\", \"keyword\": \"Publish/Subscribe; HTTP proxy; Blackadder; PURSUIT; Pub/sub proxy; network metrics; Publicera / Prenumerera; HTTP-proxy; Blackadder; PURSUIT; Pub / sub proxy; n\\u00e4tverk statistik\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-04-25T09:09:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-04-24T20:09:43.259+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T00:38:45.528+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-121282\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 70.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:551105\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"Evaluating an IPv4 and IPv6 Network\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Lidholm\", \"given\": \"Gilbert\", \"localId\": \"u1mfnwpr\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Netterberg\", \"given\": \"Marcus\", \"localId\": \"u10xs6up\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This thesis is the result of the bachelor\\u2019s thesis project \\u201cEvaluating an IPv4 and IPv6 network\\u201d.The IPv6 protocol was created with the main purpose of solving the problem of the depletion of IPaddresses that IPv4 is currently facing.

This thesis project facilitates the use of Earl in design projects for IoT devices.IoT enables communication with many different kinds of \\u201cthings\\u201d such as cars, fridges, refrigerators, light bulbs, etc. The benefits of IoT range from financial savings due to saving energy to monitoring the heart activity of a patient with heart problems. There are many approaches to connect devices in order to create an IoT. One of these approaches is to use a mobile phone as a gateway, i.e., to act as a router, between IoT and the Internet.The WebSocket protocol provides efficient communication sessions between web servers and clients by reducing communication overhead. The WebRTC project aims to provide standards for real-time communications technology. WebRTC is important because it is the first real-time communications standard which is being built into browsers.This thesis evaluates the benefits which these two protocols offer when using a mobile phone as a gateway between an IoT and Internet. This thesis project implemented several test beds, collected data concerning the scalability of the protocols and the latency of traffic passing through the gateway, and presents a numerical analysis of the measurement results.

When the number of vehicles increases, platoons will follow one another in what is referred to as multiplatooning. Many Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) applications rely on periodically exchanged beacons among vehicles to improve traffic safety. However, as the number of connected vehicles increases, the network may become congested due to periodically exchanged beacons. Therefore, without some congestion control method, safety critical messages such as Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) may not be delivered on time in high vehicle density scenarios. Both the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) have been working on different standards to support vehicular communication. ETSI dened the Decentralized Congestion Control (DCC) mechanism which adapts transmission parameters (message rate, transmit data rate, and transmit power, etc.) to keep channel load under control. ETSI DCC utilizes a three-state machine with RELAXED, ACTIVE, and RESTRICTIVE states. In this thesis, we implemented this three-state machine by adapting the message rate based on the channel busy ratio (CBR). We name this message-rate based three-state machine DCC-3. DCC-3 has the ability to control channel load; however, it has unfairness and instability problems due to the dramatic parameter changes between states. Therefore, we divided the ACTIVE state of DCC-3 into ve sub-states, and refer to this as DCC-7. We benchmarked DCC-3 against static beaconing (STB), dynamic beaconing (DynB), LInear MEssage Rate Integrated Control (LIMERIC), and DCC-7 using different evaluation metrics with different numbers of platoons. Our results from the Plexe simulator demonstrate that DCC-7 has the best performance when considering all evaluation metrics, including CBR, Inter-reception time (IRT), collisions, safe time ratio, and fairness. Furthermore, we found using transmit power control could greatly improve the performance of CBR and collision rates.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-232849\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,62\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2018:464\", \"keyword\": \"Wireless vehicular communication; decentralized congestion control; cooperative awareness messages; multiplatooning; simulation; Tr\\u00e5dl\\u00f6s fordonskommunikation; decentraliserad \\u00f6verbelastning kontroll; kooperativ medvetenhet meddelanden; multiplatooning; simulering\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-09-03T13:43:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-08-04T14:21:43.740+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T19:55:32.312+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-232849\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 75.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:510476\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2009]]}, \"title\": \"Evaluation of Capuchin Application Programming Interface : Implementing a Mobile TV Client\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Feng\", \"given\": \"Xuan\", \"localId\": \"u1e8ggjt\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Edvardsson\", \"given\": \"Nils\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The purpose of this research was to evaluate the Capuchin API launched by Sony Ericsson at Lund, Sweden in 2008.

This test application was named \\u201cMin TV\\u201d, in English: \\u201cMy TV\\u201d.\\nUsing Capuchin in the Ericsson TV lab environment has shown that it has some benefits, but also has many drawbacks. The Flash developer can be used to create an animated user interface and Java developers can do complex programming. At this early stage Capuchin technology is not mature enough, nor is it suitable for Mobile TV client development. Only after Sony Ericsson adds features such as soft keys, easier debugging of Flash Lite standalone applications, test emulator support in the software development kit, and more data communication methods than string and number, only then it will be a suitable technology for Mobile TV applications.\\nEricsson\\u2019s current Mobile TV application client was built using a framework called ECAF, which supports a graphics frontend and Java ME as backend. We compared ECAF and Min TV with respect to parameters such as: flexibility, performance, memory footprint, code size, and cost of skinning. (All these parameters are explained in detail in the methodology chapter.)\\nAs a possible future technology for Mobile TV, we evaluated a number of different presentation/graphics technologies including HECL, SVG Tiny, MIDP 3.0, .NET Compact Framework, etc. Moreover, we examed if a pure Flash Lite client application is a viable solution for Mobile TV. The comparison of different presentation technologies showed that Java ME is a comprehensive platform for mobile development offering all the necessary support from third party graphical user interface makers. .NET CF also looks like a good option for development with the scaled down capabilities for different programming languages supported using CLR.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91497\", \"number-of-pages\": \"58\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2009:97\", \"keyword\": \"Capuchin API; JAVA ME; Action Script 2.0; VoD; Linear TV; Min TV; Mobile TV; presentation technologies; experimental evaluation\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-16T13:51:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-16T11:58:00.144+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:22:32.556+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91497\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 58.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:944570\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2016]]}, \"title\": \"Evaluation of communication protocols between vehicle and server : Evaluation of data transmission overhead by communication protocols\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Wickman\", \"given\": \"Tomas\", \"localId\": \"u10rytem\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Nilsson\", \"given\": \"H\\u00e5kan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Scania\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Nordstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Ken\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Scania\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This thesis project has studied a number of protocols that could be used to communicate between a vehicle and a remote server in the context of Scania\\u2019s connected services.

One such solution is Progressive Web Application, a set of techniques that aim to create web applications with features that have traditionally only been available to native applications.In recent years WebAssembly, a compilation target that allows languages other than JavaScript to run on the browser, has been introduced. With its compact binary format and compiled nature, its goal is to bring speed and performance enhancement to web applications.This thesis analyzes WebAssembly in the context of building a Progressive Web Application, particularly the impacts it has on the performance and memory usage. A comparison is made with the JavaScript library ReactJS. The results indicate that a Progressive Web Application built with WebAssembly achieves similar performance results as one built using ReactJS when it comes to computers, but performs worse on mobile platforms. The results also indicate that using a programming language such as Rust, although still introducing memory overhead, minimizes the bundle size and runtime memory consumption of the application.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-313941\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xvi,60\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": \"Progressve Web Applications; WebAssembly; Performance evaluation; Memory usage; Progressiva Webapplikationer; WebAssembly; Prestationsutv\\u00e4rdering; Minnesanv\\u00e4ndning\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-15T07:34:01.083+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-13T14:50:07.999+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-25T07:29:55.949+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-313941\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": \"Stockholm\", \"publisher\": \"KTH Royal Institute of Technology\", \"total_pages\": 76.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1159496\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2017]]}, \"title\": \"Evaluation of the Profitability of Quality of Experience-based Resource Allocation Deployment in LTE Network : A Techno-economic Assessment based on Quality of Experience in Video Traffic\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Ramadhani\", \"given\": \"Uri Arta\", \"localId\": \"u1vojmyr\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Hossain\", \"given\": \"Mohammad Istiak\", \"localId\": \"u1spxk5c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Martinez Ballesteros\", \"given\": \"Luis Guillermo\", \"localId\": \"u1o6sxfi\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"In the current mobile telecommunication market, with slow growth in mobile subscriptions and increasing traffi demand, each mobile operator needs to manage their customer loyalty in order to maintain position in the market. To retain their customer's loyalty, the user quality of satisfaction needs to be preserved. Integrating a Quality of Experience (QoE) approach into a radio resource scheduling scheme can be a means to improve user quality of satisfaction to a service. However, the enhancement of existing resource allocation management to support a QoE-based resource scheduling scheme needs a careful consideration since it will impact the mobile operator's investment cost. A profitability assessment of QoE-based resource allocation is required as a basis for the mobile operator to forecast their potential benefit of QoE-based resource scheduling deployment.This thesis investigated the profitability of deploying QoE-based radio resource management (RRM) in terms of revenue loss compared to proportional fair (PF) scheduling, a widely used resource allocation scheme, in delivering a streaming video service. In QoE-based RRM, a buffering percentage experienced by a user was considered in the resource allocation decision process. The two scheduling schemes were simulated in different network configurations. User satisfaction was quantified in terms of mean opinion score. Given the degree of satisfaction for each user, a number of users who would be likely to churn was obtained. A cost-benefit assessment was then conducted by predicting revenue loss due to customer churn.The results from the simulation and cost analysis show that although QoE-based resource scheduling provides users with a higher degree of satisfaction for more base stations, the utilization of a QoE-based resource scheduler does not offer significant benefit to the network operator with regard to revenue loss and deployment cost when compared to a PF scheduler. This outcome indicates that if the business target is to reduce customer churn, then the operator should utilize a PF scheduler for their RRM scheme.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-218073\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiv,61\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2017:197\", \"keyword\": \"Quality of Experience; radio resource management; video quality; mean opinion score; revenue loss; upplevad kvalitet; radio resurshantering; videokvalit\\u00e9t; medelv\\u00e4rde av graderingarna; inkomstf\\u00f6rlust\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-12-10T15:00:31.997+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-11-22T16:05:07.965+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T23:17:35.786+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-218073\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 75.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:448589\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2011]]}, \"title\": \"Evaluation of VoIP Security for Mobile Devices\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Nakarmi\", \"given\": \"Prajwol Kumar\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": null, \"abstract\": \"Market research reports by In-Stat, Gartner, and the Swedish Post and Telecom Agency (PTS) reveal a growing worldwide demand for Voice over IP (VoIP) and smartphones.

This application-to-person traffic is delivered to end users through SMS aggregators who provide the link between service providers and mobile carriers. In order to perform optimal traffic routing, the aggregators need to estimate the quality of each potential international route to the specified destination. The evaluation criteria include end-to-end delivery time, as well as correct verification of delivered data.\\nThis thesis suggests a method of quality of service (QoS) assessment for international SMS service which combines two types of tests, end-to-end delay measurements and various verification tests. A prototype of the testing system for international SMS service was developed to generate SMS traffic, collect and analyze results, and evaluate the experienced QoS of the SMS route used in accordance with the proposed approach. As a part of end-to- end delay measurement tests, SMS traffic was sent to Singtel network in Singapore along two routes. The verification tests were executed via different routes to two mobile networks: Singtel and Tele2 (Sweden). The results of the performed measurements determined the route with the highest QoS, i.e. the one with bigger bottleneck bandwidth and lower data loss rate.\\nThe prototype of the SMS testing system can be used by SMS aggregators to verify delivery of a SMS message, check the integrity of the message, figure out interconnection type of the route supplier with the destination carrier and to identify the presence of load balancers in the path. The prototype also makes it possible to compare end-to-end delay times of several routes and compute bottleneck values for each of the tested routes.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-49828\", \"number-of-pages\": \"57\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"180\", \"keyword\": \"SMS; QoS; packet-pair; TOPP; end-to-end delay; bottleneck bandwidth; aggregator\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-11-30T10:41:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-11-30T10:41:30.390+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T19:53:38.752+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-49828\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 57.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:538636\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"EVH2 protocol : Performance analysis and Wireshark dissector development\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"\\u00c5hman\", \"given\": \"Stefan\", \"localId\": \"u10284r5\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Wallstersson\", \"given\": \"Marcus\", \"localId\": \"u1xj98np\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"S\\u00f6derstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Pontus\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Aptilo Networks\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Eriksson\", \"given\": \"Peter\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Aptilo Networks\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"EVH2 is a proprietary application layer protocol developed by Aptilo Networks and used in their software product.

This project take a more general look at traffic arriving at a server via a tree of network devices on the uplink path to the server. The focus is to use scripts to create a tree of switches and conduct experiments with them by scripting Mininet. From these experiments we learned that the different algorithms that control the output queues of the network nodes across the network path play a significant role in packet interleaving. Furtheromore, experiments on Mininet host connectivity explained how with the Openflow protocol, Mininet controller set up rules in the switches of the network topology.

Among the different Wireless LAN standards, the most widespread, by far, is IEEE 802.11.\\nPublic WLAN access networks are being set up in hotspots, i.e. areas expected to have high demand for bandwidth. Access to the Internet and to corporate networks is provided at these hotspots with limited coverage but high available bandwidth. Airports and hotels have often been the first targeted locations for these hotspots, but conference centres, cafes, and train stations follow. In the near future, any person who owns at least one access point and has a connection to the Internet can become a small operator and offer access to the Internet using these resources.\\nExisting solutions for such WLAN access networks lack support for security, flexible accounting, mobility, multiaccess, roaming and user-friendly login.

Furthermore, the evolution of wireless technologies has facilitated their ubiquity. Moreover, is in locations such as homes and offices where exploitation of the data from these sensors has been more important. For example, we want to know if the temperature in our home is adequate, otherwise we want to turn on the heating (or cooling) system automatically and we want to be able to monitor the environment of the home or office remotely. The knowledge from these sensors and the ability to actuate devices, summon human assistance, and adjust contracts for electrical power, heating, cooling, etc. can facilitate a myriad of ways to improve the quality of our life and potentially even reduce resource consumption.\\nThis master\\u2018s thesis project created a gateway that sniffs wireless sensor traffic in order to collect data from existing sensors and to provide this data as input to various services. These sensors work in the 868 MHz band. Although these wireless sensors are frequently installed in homes and offices, they are generally not connected to any network. We designed a gateway capable of identifying these wireless sensors and decoding the received messages, despite the fact that these messages may use a vendor\\u2018s proprietary protocol. This gateway consists of a microcontroller, a radio transceiver (868-915 MHz), and an Ethernet controller.\\nThis gateway enables us to take advantage of all the data that can be captured. Thinking about these possibilities, simultaneously acquiring data from these various sensors could open a wide range of alternatives in different fields, such as home automation, industrial controlling\\u2026 Not only can the received data be interesting by itself; but when different sensors are located in the same environment we can exploit this data using sensor fusion. For example, time differences in arrival and differences in signal strength as measured t multiple receivers could be used to locate objects.\\nThe final aim of this thesis project is to support diverse applications that could be developed using the new gateway. This gateway creates a bridge between the information that is already around us and our ability to realize many new potential services. A wide range of opportunities could be realized by exploiting the wireless sensors we already have close to us.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98209\", \"number-of-pages\": \"81\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:110\", \"keyword\": \"wireless sensor gateway; microcontoller; power over ethernet\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-26T13:50:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-20T10:15:04.887+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:10:05.949+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98209\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 81.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:374024\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2010]]}, \"title\": \"Exploring the limits of cloud computing\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Delgado\", \"given\": \"Victor\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": null, \"abstract\": \"Cloud computing \\u00e4r en ny computing paradigm som, precis som elektricitet var f\\u00f6rst genereras hemma och utvecklats som skall levereras fr\\u00e5n ett f\\u00e5tal verktyg leverant\\u00f6rer, syftar till att omvandla data till ett verktyg.

IPSec is not yet spread over a large market, but it offers a very flexible solution. Kerberos has great security mechanisms, but requires a lot of work and can be pretty hard to implement in an Extranet. S-HTTP conquers with SSL about security on the web market. Since it is intended for web traffic only, it is not an alternative for MIJADA to chose. PGP have very strong security mechanisms and overcomes the United States export laws, but to implement it implies also an own implementation of a protocol stack, which requires a large amount of extra time.\\nThe recommendation that this paper present for MIJADA is to choose SSL as underlying security technology, since it is most flexible and offers the best way to achieve mobility, i.e., allowing users to login to the Extranet from different computers. Furthermore, this paper recommends employing firewalls on both sides of the server running the SSL security component. One of them protects the server from being tampered, and the other protects the Extranet from harmful data that in somehow has passed the server.

There is a service within the Orc Server System which provides an interface for communication with the Orc Server System. Clients can communicate via this interface using the Orc Protocol (OP).\\nBanks and brokers usually have different systems that are specialized for different needs.

This evaluation shows that OP parser/generator is both faster and less memory demanding than the manually generated FIX client.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92010\", \"number-of-pages\": \"54\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2007-17\", \"keyword\": \"Parsing; Communication; Java; Finance\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T15:52:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T15:44:16.398+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:14:37.053+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92010\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 54.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:510606\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2009]]}, \"title\": \"Facilitating the adoption and use of the IP Multimedia System\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Papazafeiropoulos\", \"given\": \"Christos\", \"localId\": \"u1wmpdxh\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"\\u00c5str\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Michael\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is still under development and not widely adopted in the market. Some companies are reluctant to deploy IMS and some telecommunications vendors believe that IMS will not achieve a desirable market share. The purpose of this thesis work is to give a boost to this technology (i.e., to accelerate its market growth) by providing the community (both developers and operators who might adopt this technology) with an evaluation of the Ericsson Java Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) called Mobile Java Communication Framework (MJCF) APIs. Developers with or even without knowledge of the IMS architecture and signaling should be able to use these interfaces in order to develop applications on top of IMS.\\nA client-server application is designed and implemented to facilitate this evaluation and to serve as an example for others. The motivation behind this application is the every day needs of the people who search for discounts while they are shopping. Users set up their profile by specifying their preference concerning discounts for specific products; while shop owners publish discounts. When a user is near a store which offers interesting discounts (i.e., discounts that match their profile) new notifications will be sent to his/her mobile device. This application exploits the MJCF APIs and uses several of its basic functions; specifically subscriptions, messages, notifications, and publications are some of the messages that can be utilized through these interfaces.&lt;/p&gt; Throughout the application development, bugs were found in the APIs and corrections were suggested for the documentation. Measurements were made in order to evaluate the memory utilization and delay associated with these APIs. It was observed that the delays added by the APIs are somewhat high and may negatively affect the experience of users. However memory utilization seamed to be low for client applications and quite high for the server side given the resources of today's services and cellular phones.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91530\", \"number-of-pages\": \"44\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2009-02\", \"keyword\": \"IMS; API; SIP\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-20T10:45:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-16T17:46:26.464+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:21:51.931+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91530\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 44.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:517618\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"Fast and Gigabit Ethernet vs. ATMfor Campus Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Nilsson\", \"given\": \"Michael\", \"localId\": \"u1owul0r\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Lindblad\", \"given\": \"Jan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Real Estate and Services AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This Master\\u2019s Thesis discusses the use of ATM versus Fast and Gigabit Ethernet in Campus Networks.

Each technology is appropriate for specific applications. Gigabit Ethernet is appropriate in areas where high data throughput is required, but QoS is not a main concern. ATM is appropriate in environments where video, voice, and other delay sensitive traffic exist. Fast Ethernet has the best price/performance for regular desktop connections. If the desktops have low need for bandwidth, they can be connected with 10/100 MB NICs to 10-MB-ports in the switch. When the need arise, the connections can be upgraded to 100 MB. Gigabit Ethernet is also recommended for server connections. Depending on the need for bandwidth, Fast or Gigabit Ethernet is recommended.\\nFor campus backbones, Gigabit Ethernet is recommended for all companies and organisations that do not run delay sensitive applications and therefor need QoS.\\n\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93720\", \"number-of-pages\": \"82\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-20T14:24:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-24T12:53:05.822+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:47:07.931+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93720\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 82.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:529914\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1998]]}, \"title\": \"Fault corrections dealing with external B-party information\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Sheikholmolouki\", \"given\": \"Daria\", \"localId\": \"u1hudhst\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Andersson\", \"given\": \"Hans\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Business Communication\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The MD 110 is a Private Automatic Branch eXchange (PABX) that employs digital switching and transmission techniques.

To achieve this goal, a mechanism offering reliable and systematic protocol verification is needed. Accordingly, a major interest in academic research on formal methods for protocol analysis has been apparent for the last two decades. Such methods formalize the operational semantics of a protocol, laying the base for protocol verification with automatic model checking tools.So far, little work in this field has focused on protocol standardization. Within this thesis a security analysis of a novel Authenticated Key-Exchange (AKE) protocol for secure association handover between two Long-Term Evolution (LTE) base stations (which support dual-connectivity) is carried out by applying two state-of-the-art tools for automated model checking (Scyther and Tamarin Prover). In the course of this a formal protocol model and tool input models are developed. Finally, the suitability of the used tools for LTE protocol analysis is evaluated.The major outcome is that none of the two applied tools is capable to accurately model and verify the dual-connectivity protocol in such detail that it would make them particularly useful in the considered setting. The reason for this are restrictions in the syntax of Scyther and a degraded performance of Tamarin when using complex protocol input models. However, the use of formal methods in protocol standardization can be highly beneficial, since it implies a careful consideration of a protocol\\u2019s fundamentals. Hence, formal methods are helpful to improve and structure a protocol\\u2019s design process when applied in conjunction to current practices.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-148047\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xvii,85\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2014:94\", \"keyword\": \"security; authenticated key-exchange; 3GPP; LTE; formal methods; protocol verification; automated model checking; s\\u00e4kerhet; autentiserad etablering av nycklar; 3GPP; LTE; formella metoder; protokollverifiering; automatiserad modellverifiering\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-08-05T15:51:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-07-18T16:22:01.062+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T19:18:06.741+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-148047\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 102.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:753000\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2014]]}, \"title\": \"From Set Top Box to Home Media Center\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Fu\", \"given\": \"Yi\", \"localId\": \"u1bybb0s\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Li\", \"given\": \"Ruimin\", \"localId\": \"u1519ool\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Eriksson\", \"given\": \"Andreas\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Zenterio AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Although Set-top-Boxes(STBs) are widely deployed today to connect a media source to a display (traditionally a television set), the market is changing due to the introduction of Internet Protocol Television, Over-the-Top streaming devices, gaming console, home theater Personal Computer, smart TV, etc. There is an evolving concept of a Home Media Center (HMC).

It is a very dynamic protocol suite, consisting of several protocols that enable a number of different security services. As IPsec enables flexible security, there is a need for agreements between the parties. All network nodes that utilize IPsec need to keep track of their agreements with their peer nodes, this information is stored in a Security Policy Database (SPD).In a network environment where thousands of pairs of nodes may communicate, it is important that lookups in the SPD occur quickly. The SPD usually operates with a small number of agreements, which suggest that the data structure it utilizes should be rather simple. However, the data structure should scale properly, even when the number of agreements increases to a very large number. This masters thesis examines existing implementations of a SPD and the existing data structures used for SPD implementation. It then tries to identify what makes a good implementation. Subsequently, a generic data structure is proposed for use as a SPD.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-99122\", \"number-of-pages\": \"80\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2008-06\", \"keyword\": \"IPsec; Security Policy Database; SPD; IP security; packet classification; heuristic algorithm\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-07-30T14:24:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-07-13T13:14:06.622+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T03:58:54.122+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-99122\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 80.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1573400\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2021]]}, \"title\": \"Geo-Enabling Piste Maps Using Anchor Points\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Pei\", \"given\": \"Lou-Lou\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879223\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r elektroteknik och datavetenskap (EECS)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Lane\", \"given\": \"H\\u00e5kan\", \"localId\": \"u1xewqw3\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879223\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r elektroteknik och datavetenskap (EECS)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Piste maps have been used as navigational aids by winter sports enthusiasts for decades. These maps are often hand drawn and are designed to be visually pleasing while still providing an overview of the terrain of a ski resort. As smartphones have become the go-to tool when satisfying our daily navigational needs, the expectations of a digital map have changed. One of these expectations is being able to position yourself and others on the map. With the existing GPS functionality of smartphones, there is a great potential for bringing classical piste maps into the digital age. This project proposes a solution which can position a user given their geographical position on a piste map. The solution includes a process for identifying anchor points which tie geographical coordinates to piste map coordinates, a suitable method of triangulating these points, combined with an algorithm that finds the most suitable triangle to use for finding the transformation parameters, and finally an affine transformation that yields the corresponding piste map coordinates for a given geographical position. The solution also proposes a method to find the smallest but sufficient set size of anchor points for a resort to create a useful and cost efficient model of transformation. The thesis work also presents possible implementations of the positioning algorithm, such as creating a smooth transition between a piste map view and a satellite map view in an Android device. This includes automatic panning and rotation of the satellite map in response to the centering of the piste map on the device screen. Geo-enabling piste maps enables many more interesting applications, such as recording and displaying skiing statistics, providing suggestions of new unexplored areas, keeping track of family or friends, selective location sharing, location-tagged weather and disaster information, and in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, providing a user- friendly interface for displaying localized congestion levels.\\u00a0\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-298026\", \"number-of-pages\": \"70\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2021:218\", \"keyword\": \"Georeferencing; Positioning; Coordinate Transformations; Piste maps; Geografiska referenspunkter; Positionering; Koordinattransformationer; Pistkartor\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2021-06-28T09:53:36.176+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2021-06-24T17:33:25.864+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-25T12:05:30.678+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-298026\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 70.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:526424\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"Global Secure Message Handling\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Lindman\", \"given\": \"Johannes\", \"localId\": \"u15un3t0\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Johansson\", \"given\": \"Peter\", \"localId\": \"u1psaq0a\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Nilsson\", \"given\": \"Torkel\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"ABN Amro Software\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Targama\", \"given\": \"Jakob\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"ABN Amro Software\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The goal of this report is to devise a mechanism for sending messages in a non-secure environment, such as the Internet.

Force-based layout spreads out the nodes in an adaptive fashion. The adaptive filters starts by showing what is most often the most relevant information, but can be configured by the user. Finally, the vector based rendering offers unlimited zoom into the individual nodes in the graph in order to display additional detailed information.Unified Modeling Language (UML) sequence charts are used to display the message flow inside the system (both between nodes and inside individual nodes).To validate the results of this thesis project each iteration of the design was evaluated through meetings with the staff at Aptilo Networks. These meetings provided feedback on the direction the project was taking as well as provided input (such as ideas for features to implement).The result of this thesis project shows a way to display the status of an AAA system with multiple properties displayed at the same time. It combines this with a view of the flow of messages and application of policies in the network via a dynamically generated UML sequence diagram.

In particular, the needs due to the introduction of a new electronic ID system in Sweden (the Federation of Swedish eID) and how signatures are created and managed.SafeNet Luna SA 1700 is a high performance HSM's available in the current market. In this thesis the Luna SA 1700 capabilities are stated and a comprehensive analysis of its performance shows a performance gap between what HSMs are currently able to do and what they need to do to address the expected demands. A case study focused on new security services needed to address Sweden's e Identification organization is presented. Based upon the expected performance demands, this thesis project proposes an optimized HSM solution to address the identified performance gap between what is required and what current HSMs can provide. A series of tests were conducted to measure an existing HSM's performance. An analysis of these measurements was used to optimize a proposed solution for selected HSM or similar HSMs. One of the main requirements of the new signing service is the capability to perform fifty digital signatures within the acceptable response time which is 300 ms during normal hours and 3000 ms during peak hours. The proposed solution enables the HSM to meet the expected demands of 50 signing request per second in the assumed two hours of peak rate at a cost that is 1/9 of the cost of simply scaling up the number of HSMs.The target audience of this thesis project is Security Service Providers who use HSMs and need a high volume of key generation and storing. Also HSM vendors consider this solution and add similar functionality to their devices in order to meet the desired demands and to ensure a better future in this very rapidly growing market.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-158122\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,54\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2014:182\", \"keyword\": \"HSM; Digital Signature; PKI; e-Identification; RSA; SAML; HSM; Digitala signatur; PKI; e-legitimation; RSA; SAML\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-12-30T14:29:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-12-25T14:18:45.461+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T16:35:28.514+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-158122\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 67.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1356732\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2019]]}, \"title\": \"Hardware-Efficient WDM/SDM Network : Smart Resource Allocation with SDN Controller\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Liu\", \"given\": \"Lida\", \"localId\": \"u1dtay5b\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879305\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Yan\", \"given\": \"Shuangyi\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"University of Bristol \"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Optical networking has been developing for decades and wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) is the main technology used to carry signals in fiber-optical communication systems. However, its development has slowed because it is approaching the Shannon limit of nonlinear fiber transmission. Researchers are looking for multi dimensional multiplexing. Space-division multiplexing (SDM) is an ideal way to scale network capacities. The capacity of WDM/SDM network could be expanded to several times the capacity of WDM network but the active hardware devices may also increase by several times.This project aims to answer a practical question: How to construct a WDM/SDM network with less hardware resource? There is no mature research about WDM/SDM network yet. Therefore, the problem can be divided into two parts: (1) how to build a WDM/SDM network and (2) how to allocate resource and compute routes in such a network to minimize hardware resources.First, this thesis proposes a WDM/SDM node which has bypass connections between different fibers and architecture on demand (AoD) to effectively decrease the number of active hardware devices within the node. Then, two types of networks were constructed: one with bypass connections in each node and another one without any bypass connections. These networks were under the control of a software defined network (SDN) controller. The controller knew the wavelength resources within the networks. Several algorithms were applied to these networks to evaluate the effect of a bypass network and to identify the desired characteristics (to find short length path and decrease the probability of spectrum fragmentation) of an algorithm suitable for a network with bypass connections. The results of applying the proposed algorithms in two networks proved that the bypass connections increased the blocking probability in small topology but did not affect the results in large topology. The results in a large-scale network with bypass network were almost the same as the results in a network without bypass connections. Thus, bypass connections are suitable for large-scale network.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-261155\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,69\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2019:695\", \"keyword\": \"WDM; SDM; SDN; routing and wavelength assignment; large-scale network; hardware resource; WDM; SDM; SDN; routing och tilldelning av v\\u00e5gl\\u00e4ngd; storskaligt n\\u00e4tverk; h\\u00e5rdvara resurs\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2019-10-14T07:14:38.265+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2019-10-02T10:52:35.659+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T13:35:47.233+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-261155\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 82.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1678555\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2022]]}, \"title\": \"Hardware-in-the-loop Simulation of a Pumping Station : Design and implementation of a Python-based simulation program\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Liang\", \"given\": \"Katrina\", \"localId\": \"u1jwhwdj\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879223\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r elektroteknik och datavetenskap (EECS)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Stjern\", \"given\": \"Magnus\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Xylem Water Solutions AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The use of simulation enables testing of a system without the need for a complete physical system, while also having the advantages of lower cost and fewer practical limits compared to field tests.

Nevertheless, the developers do not always have access to a real pumping station to run tests on. A HIL simulator that imitates parts of a pumping station while including a real controller in the simulation is therefore desirable for the development of pump controllers.In this thesis, a mathematical model of a pumping station was built based on the physical features of different components, and a HIL simulation was implemented with the programming language Python, in which a real controller was integrated into the simulation loop.Through a three-hour-long simulation run, the functionality of the simulator has been analyzed, and the simulation accuracy was evaluated by comparing simulated results to real data.

To gain an increased understanding of the threat landscape in RANs and potentially increase the overall security for RANs, this thesis project designed, implemented, and evaluated a honeypot for Ericsson\\u2019s RAN. Developing a suitable honeypot required an initial literature study of honeypots, RANs, and Long-Term Evolution (LTE) networks. In addition, previous research and work related to this topic were included in the literature study. The open-source Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) honeypot project, Cowrie, was used as a fundamental building block for the honeypot. Moreover, a high-level architecture of the honeypot system (HoneyRAN) was designed and used as a basis for the implementation process. For evaluating the honeypot, a penetration test was conducted in which an internal Ericsson penetration tester evaluated the honeypot. The Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) stack was utilised to facilitate log analysis. The results from the penetration test were better than expected and are promising as HoneyRAN achieved the three claimed goals/objectives: understanding adversarial behaviour and tactics, stalling the adversaries, and early detection of attacks. The outcome of the evaluation suggests that HoneyRAN is a good initial approach for increasing the overall security of RANs and that honeypots are an effective deception technique for stalling attackers. The conclusions from the evaluation of HoneyRAN are that HoneyRAN\\u2019s implementation using Cowrie achieved an essential desired outcome, namely realism, deception strategies are essential to implement deception techniques (such as honeypots) effectively, and the design and implementation choices of HoneyRAN provides a foundation for other solutions.\\u00a0\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-305168\", \"number-of-pages\": \"114\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2021:712\", \"keyword\": \"Honeypot; HoneyRAN; Medium Interaction Honeypot; Cowrie; SSH Honeypot; RAN Honeypot; RAN security; Honungskruka; HoneyRAN; Medelinteraktion honungskruka; Cowrie; SSH honungskruka; RAN honungskruka; RAN s\\u00e4kerhet\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2021-11-23T12:52:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2021-11-22T15:41:32.239+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-25T09:59:36.550+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-305168\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 114.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:513071\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2005]]}, \"title\": \"Horizontal Handoffs within WLANs : A detailed analysis and measurement concerning voice like traffic\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Nankani\", \"given\": \"Ajeet\", \"localId\": \"u1fi1kyv\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"B\\u00f6rjeson\", \"given\": \"Ulf\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"R2M AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"IEEE 802.11 based Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) in addition to being used as access networks for providing traditional data services, are now also being used as access networks for providing realtime services such as VoIP and multimedia streaming.

The IEEE 802.11 standard does not define any technique or algorithm to provide seamless connectivity during the process of handoff, hence it does not require 802.11 based WLANs to provide the same. Thus, it is typical that there is a latency of 500 milliseconds to 1000 milliseconds during the handoff, before the mobile station can connect and receive data from the new access point (AP). However, many realtime services can not tolerate this much latency.The problem of handoff latency is further aggravated when WLANs are secured using IEEE 802.11i standard and when Authentication, Authorization &amp; Accounting (AAA) services are involved in controlling network access to 802.11 based WLANs. This thesis will address the entire handoff process and examine the latency -- especially regarding AAA services. Different techniques and suggestions will be presented and analyzed closely at different layers and based on the results, an appropriate/efficient algorithm is suggested which will reduce this handoff latency, such that that seamless handoff can be achieved and realtime services can be provided over 802.11i enabled IEEE 802.11 WLANs.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92271\", \"number-of-pages\": \"61\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-IMIT-LCN.

Time division (TD) scheduling in Wideband Code Division Multiplex Access (WCDMA) is considered to be a key feature in achieving high user data rates. Unfortunately, power oscillation/peak is observed in time division multiplexing (TDM) at the transition between active and inactive transmission time intervals [1]. Therefore there is a need to revisit power control algorithms for different time division scheduling scenarios.The objective of power control in the context of this study is to minimize the required rise over thermal noise (RoT) for a given data rate, subject to the constraint that the physical layer control channel quality is sufficient (assuming that the dedicated physical control channel (DPCCH) SIR should not go below 3dB with a probability of at most 5%). Another goal is to minimize the local oscillation in power (power peaks) that may occur, for example due to transitions between active and inactive transmission time intervals.The considered hybrid power control schemes are: (1) non-parametric Generalized rake receiver SIR (GSIR) Inner Loop Power Control (ILPC) during active transmission time intervals + Received Signal Code Power (RSCP) ILPC during inactive transmission time intervals and (2) RSCP ILPC during active transmission time intervals + GSIR ILPC during inactive transmission time intervals. Both schemes are compared with pure GSIR and pure RSCP ILPC.Link level simulations with multiple users connected to a single cell show that:<ul><li>The power peak problem is obviously observed in GSIR + GSIR transmit power control (TPC), but in general it performs well in all time division scenarios studied. GSIR outperforms other TPC methods in terms of RoT, especially in the TU channel model. This is because it is good in combating instantaneously changed fading and accurately estimates SIR. Among all TPC methods presented, GSIR + GSIR TPC is best in maintaining the quality of the DPCCH channel. No power rush is observed when using GSIR + GSIR TPC.</li><li>RSCP + RSCP eliminates the power peak problem and outperforms other TPC methods presented under the 3GPP Pedestrial A (pedA) 3km/h channel in terms of RoT. However, in general it is worse in maintaining the control channel\\u2019s quality than GSIR + GSIR TPC.</li><li>GSIR + RSCP ILPC eliminates the power peak problem and out-performs GSIR power control in the scenario of 2 and 4 TDM high data rate (HDR) UE and 2 TDM HDR UE coexistence with 4 Code DivisionMultiplex (CDM) LDR UE, in the pedA 3km/h channel, in terms of RoT. However, the control channel quality is not maintained as well during inactive transmission time intervals.</li><li>It is not recommended to use RSCP + GSIR TPC since it performs worst among these TPC methods for most of the cases in terms of RoT, even though it is the second best in maintaining the control channel quality.

Discrete event simulation is a major experimental methodology in several scientific and engineering domains. Unfortunately, a conventional discrete event simulator cannot meet with increasing demands of computational or the structural complexities of modern systems such as peer-to-peer (P2P) systems; therefore parallel discrete event simulation has been a focus of researchers for several decades.\\nUnfortunately, no simulator is regarded as a standard which can satisfy the demands of all kinds of applications. Thus while given a simulator yields good performance for a specific kind of applications, it may failed to be efficient for other kinds of applications. Furthermore, although technological advancements have been made in the multi-core computing hardware, none of the mainstream P2P discrete event simulators is designed to support parallel simulation that exploits multi-core architectures. The proposed HydraNetSim parallel discrete event simulator (PDES) is a step toward addressing these issues. Developing a simulator which can support very large numbers of nodes to realize a massive P2P system, and can also execute in parallel is a non-trivial task. The literature review in this thesis gives a broad overview of prevailing approaches to dealing with the tricky problems of simulating a massive, large, and rapidly changing system, and provides a foundation for adopting a suitable architecture for developing a PDES.\\nHydraNetSim is a discrete event simulator which allows parallel simulation and exploits the capabilities of parallelization of modern computing hardware. It is based on a novel master/slave paradigm. It divides the simulation model into a number of specific slaves (a cluster of processes) considering the number of cores provided by the underlying computing hardware. Each slave can be assigned to a specific CPU on a different core. Synchronization of the slaves is achieved by proposing a variant of the classic Null-Message Algorithm (NMA) with a focus on keeping the synchronization overhead as low as possible. Furthermore, HydraNetSim provides log information for debugging purposes and introduces a new mechanism of gathering and writing simulation results to a database.\\nThe experimental results show that the sequential counterpart of HydraNetSim (SDES) takes 41.6% more time than HydraNetSim-2Slave and 23.6% than HydraNetSim-3Slave. HydraNetSim-2Slave is 1.42 times faster, consumes 1.18 times more memory, and supports 2.02 times more nodes than a sequential discrete event simulator (SDES). Whereas, HydraNetSim-3Slave executes 1.24 times faster, consumes 2.08 times more memory, and supports 3.04 times more nodes than SDES. The scaling factor of HydraNetSim is \\u2308(\\u03b2-1)*102.04%\\u2309 of the maximum numbered of nodes supported by SDES; where \\u03b2 is the number of slaves.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98905\", \"number-of-pages\": \"85\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:125\", \"keyword\": \"parallel discrete event simulation; P2P; Conservative synchronization; null message algorithm (NMA); network simulation\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-07-05T14:32:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-07-05T14:18:15.643+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:01:27.046+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98905\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 85.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:513838\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2004]]}, \"title\": \"IEEE 802.11b MAC layer's influence on VoIP quality parameters : Measurements and Analysis\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Mart\\u00edn Severiano\", \"given\": \"Juan Carlos\", \"localId\": \"u1vjqkgt\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6215\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Marsh\", \"given\": \"Ian\", \"localId\": \"u1jic5dt\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"SICS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Real-time voice measurements were performed to assess whether there are significant problems with 802.11b wireless networks regarding real-time voice communication.

Microservices provides many benefits that help with code base comprehension, deployability, testability, and scalability. As the Information technology (IT) industry has grown ever larger, it makes sense for the technology giants to adopt the microservice architecture to make use of these benefits. However, with new software solutions come new security vulnerabilities, especially when the technology is new and vulnerabilities are yet to be fully mapped out. Authentication and authorization are the cornerstone of any application that has a multitude of users. However, due to the lack of studies of microservices, stemming from their relatively young age, there are no standardized design patterns for how authentication and authorization are best implemented in a microservice. This thesis investigates an existing microservice in order to secure it by applying what is known as a security design pattern for authentication and authorization. Different security patterns were tested and compared on performance. The differing levels of security provided by these approaches assisted in identifying an acceptable security versus performance trade-off. Ultimately, the goal was to give the patterns greater validity as accepted security patterns within the area of microservice security. Another goal was to find such a security pattern suitable for the given microservice used in this project. The results showed a correlation between increased security and longer response times. For the general case a security pattern which provided internal authentication and authorization but with some trust between services was suggested. If horizontal scaling was used the results showed that normal services proved to be the best target. Further, it was also revealed that for lower user counts the performance penalties were close to equal between the tested patterns. This meant that for the specific case where microservices sees lower amounts of traffic the recommended pattern was the one that implemented the maximum amount access control checks. In the case for the environment where the research were performed low amounts of traffic was seen and the recommended security pattern was therefore one that secured all services of the microservices.\\u00a0\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-301620\", \"number-of-pages\": \"87\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2021:390\", \"keyword\": \"Authentication; Authorization; Access control; Microservices; Microservice Security; Security Tokens; Security Patterns; Performance; Autentisering; Auktorisering; \\u00c5tkomstkontroll; Mikrotj\\u00e4nster; Mikrotj\\u00e4nsts\\u00e4kerhet; S\\u00e4kerhetstokens; S\\u00e4kerhetsdesignm\\u00f6nster; Prestanda; Belastningstestning\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2021-09-10T09:32:27.843+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2021-09-09T09:49:20.468+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-25T11:08:54.510+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-301620\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 87.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:510981\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2008]]}, \"title\": \"Implementation and Analysis of VoIP CPE Management System using TR-069\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Darwis\", \"given\": \"Darwis\", \"localId\": \"u1pscjb0\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Cederberg\", \"given\": \"Olle\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"42networks AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) management is underestimated by the CPE vendors and services providers while it is in fact one of the most important aspects to ensure the high quality of service.

However, SNMP alone was thought not to scale nor to support the provisioning of the types of services which internet services providers must support today.\\nThis thesis highlights the importance of CPE management, how it is implemented using the TR-069; a CPE management protocol defined by the DSL Forum, and how a management system can be used for VoIP service management, and whether a CPE should implement TR-069 or SNMP as the management system to support. In the addition, the TR-069 will be compared against the SNMP to determine which one is more suitable for CPE management.

This thesis addresses the problem of service discovery in peer-to-peer mobile networks by implementing and evaluating a previously designed protocl (the Service Peer Discovery Protocol).The main feature of peer-to-peer networks is that users connected to them can communicate directly with each other, without the necessity of interaction via a central point. However, in order for two networks users (ir peers) to communicate, they must have a means to locate and address each other, which is in gernal called a discovery protocol.There are many different solutions for discoverying protocols that work efficiently in fixed or slow-moving networks, but full mobility introduces a set of new difficulties for the discovery of peers and their services. The potential changes in location, which can occur very ofter, the changes in IP address that these changes cuase, and roaming between networks of different kinds are good examples of these difficulties.To solve these problems, a new Service Peer Discovery Protocol was designed and a test application built. The next step towards the introduction of this protocol was creating a working implementation, setting up a suitable test environment, performing experiments, and evaluating its performance. This evaluation could lead to improvments in the protoocl. The aim of this thesis is to implement and document the Service Peer Discovery Protocol, to carry out measurements of it, to evaluate the efficiency of the protocol, and to suggest ways in which it could be improved.The Service Peer Discovery Protocol was found to be well targeted to wireless, peer-to-peer networks, althgouh improvements in the protocol could make it more time and traffic-efficient while maintaining the same level of performance.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92581\", \"number-of-pages\": \"83\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-IMIT-LCN.

The AUTomotive Open System Architecture (AUTOSAR) was created to standardize the automotive software. In this architecture, the development of software is spread, in general, between three different entities: Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), e.g. Volvo; Tier-1 Suppliers, such as Vector; and Tier-2 Suppliers, for example, Renesas Microelectronics. Another methodology that has emerged is to develop Electronic Control Units (ECUs) domain wise: infotainment, chassis &amp; safety, powertrain, and body and security. To allow inter-domain communication, the state of art for fast and reliable communication is to use a gateway ECU.The gateway ECU is a crucial component in the electrical/electronic (E/E) architecture of a vehicle. In AUTOSAR, a third party, different from the car manufacturer, typically implements the gateway ECU. A major feature for a gateway ECU is to provide highly flexible configuration. This flexibility allows the car manufacturer (OEM) to fit the gateway ECU to different requirements and product derivations.This thesis investigates the implementation of post-build configuration for a gateway ECU. First, the thesis provides the reader with some background on AUTOSAR and the current E/E architecture of the gateway ECU. The protocols used by the gateway are explained. The design of a potential solution and its implementation are discussed. The implementation is evaluated through regression tests of the routing functionality. Processing time, memory use, and scaling of the solution are also taken into account.The results of the design and the implementation if judged adequate could be used as a springboard to allow post-build in an existing gateway ECU architecture. The results could consolidate the path towards full conformance to AUTOSAR.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-231545\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,50\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2018:165\", \"keyword\": \"ECU; Gateway; AUTOSAR; Post-Build; Dynamic configuration; Automobile; Calculateur; Configuration Post-Build (dynamique); AUTOSAR; ECU; AUTOSAR; Post-Build konfigurationen; F\\u00f6rmedlingsnod ECU\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-06-29T12:28:45.400+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-06-29T12:20:08.602+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T20:20:34.017+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-231545\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 63.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:564896\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1996]]}, \"title\": \"Implementation of the Mobile Floating Agent Technique\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Beermann\", \"given\": \"Mikael\", \"localId\": \"u1bt6onl\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Liu\", \"given\": \"George Yuejin\", \"localId\": \"u1bp1p2a\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The computer has undergone an explosive development since they first arrived. Today nearly everybody uses computers more or less frequently. The trend is now that everyone has a little computer connected to others in a network. The computing power has become more decentralized, and therefore the need for communication has increased. Another thing that has changed the pattern is that the computers has become so small that it is no longer any problem to move them as long as one does not care about the network support, but of course one would like to have both the mobility and the network support.In my master thesis project I have implemented and evaluated parts of a new approach for dealing with the problems with mobility. This approach is called the mobile floating agent technique, and was developed by George Y. Liu at Ericsson Radio Systems AB, Kista. The main idea behind this is to have floating agents in the network, i.e. software entities that are virtually floating around in the network, arranging files and resources for the mobile user so that he can connect to a server in his neighbourhood, instead of connecting to his own server far away.\\u00a0 I have implemented a simple file system testbed that uses the floating agent technique for caching purposes. There are two reasons for doing this implementation. The reason is for evaluation of the caching features, and the second reason is to have a platform to implement more advanced agent functions on.The design of the system has been done in an object oriented style, and the implementation has been done in C++.The system consists of two parts. One part is the client software, which has been implemented in another project, but modified by me, and runs on aPC with the Windows95 OS. The other part is the network part of the system, i.e. the part of the system that is not running in the client, is made for running on an UNIX station. The network part of the system consists of two parts itself. There are mobile floating agent managers, that manages the whole system, and agents, that serves the mobile clients, and communicates with both the client software and the mobile floating agent managers.In the evaluation part of the project I have compared the delay acquired when accessing a file in a remote network with and without an agent. I finally came to the conclusion that the gain won with the use of caches in the agents is maybe not as large that one should use caching as the primary object of the agents.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-104477\", \"number-of-pages\": \"49\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-11-05T15:42:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-11-05T13:33:07.625+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T02:42:00.933+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-104477\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 49.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511671\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2007]]}, \"title\": \"Implementing a virtual private network\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Samuelsson\", \"given\": \"Joakim\", \"localId\": \"u1gfwsod\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Sandsund\", \"given\": \"Richard\", \"localId\": \"u1nlxksr\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Dagens f\\u00f6retag vill ge anst\\u00e4llda m\\u00f6jlighet att jobba hemifr\\u00e5n eller p\\u00e5 resande fot.

The focus of this report is a general solution for communicating alarm information from external systems to the WCU. A given requirement was that the solution must be based on SOA. Therefore, the concept of SOA is investigated and its applicability is considered for the WCU architecture.\\nA design proposal based on a combination of open information and communication technologies was made to show how WCU may use SOA to receive alarm information from external systems. The design proposal was evaluated by a load test as well as comparing its conformance to SOA. The load test showed that the proposed solution can process incoming messages at a rate of 2 ms per message when client and server are run on the same machine. The result of the comparison showed that the WCU can, with small modifications, apply a SOA.\\nWhile this thesis has only investigated the use of SOA in the context of alarm information, there is a clear trend toward integrating information for diverse systems to enable users to have better quality information. Providing first responders with the information that they need, when and where they need it can enable them to save lives, save property, and reduce the risk to the public of incidents.\\nAn important result from this thesis is the observation that a system that needs to integrate with many distinct systems can be better prepared if made SOA conformant. This requires the system to have an interface towards other systems based on platform independent protocols. Systems such as the WCU, which are based on Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), can easily add such an interface by configuring WCF in an appropriate way.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92027\", \"number-of-pages\": \"68\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2007-04\", \"keyword\": \"SOA; .NET; WCF; Web Services; alarm system; XML\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-26T10:55:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T17:14:42.524+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:14:10.163+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92027\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 68.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1484246\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2020]]}, \"title\": \"Improving the performance of stream processing pipeline for vehicle data\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Gu\", \"given\": \"Wenyu\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879223\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r elektroteknik och datavetenskap (EECS)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": []}], \"abstract\": \"The growing amount of position-dependent data (containing both geo position data (i.e. latitude, longitude) and also vehicle/driver-related information) collected from sensors on vehicles poses a challenge to computer programs to process the aggregate amount of data from many vehicles.

We derive from these measurements an estimate of a device's location, and make this location information available via a SIP Presence User Agent, thus making location information readily available to services that might wish to use this information - while hiding details of how this information is acquired from these services.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91868\", \"number-of-pages\": \"72\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2008-04\", \"keyword\": \"Location Sensing; WLAN; SIP; SIMPLE; Presence User Agent; Context-aware Computing\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T15:56:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-21T14:58:00.773+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:16:38.277+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91868\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 72.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1678561\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2022]]}, \"title\": \"Increased evasion resilience in modern PDF malware detectors : Using a more evasive training dataset\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Ekholm\", \"given\": \"Oscar\", \"localId\": \"u1x216qn\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879223\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r elektroteknik och datavetenskap (EECS)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Guanciale\", \"given\": \"Roberto\", \"localId\": \"u1f9irum\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"882650\", \"name\": \"KTH, Datavetenskap\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Bartolini\", \"given\": \"Gabriel\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Subset\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The large scale usage of the PDF coupled with its versatility has made the format an attractive target for carrying and deploying malware. Traditional antivirus software struggles against new malware and PDF's vast obfuscation options. In the search of better detection systems, machine learning based detectors have been developed. Although their approaches vary, some strictly examine structural features of the document whereas other examine the behavior of embedded code, they generally share high accuracy against the evaluation data they have been tested against. However, structural machine learning based PDF malware detectors have been found to be weak against targeted evasion attempts that may be found in more sophisticated malware. Such evasion attempts typically exploit knowledge of what the detection system associates with 'benign' and 'malicious' to emulate benign features or exploit a bug in the implementation, with the purpose of evading the detector. Since the introduction of such evasion attacks more structural detectors have been developed, without introducing mitigations against such evasion attacks. This thesis aggregates the existing knowledge of evasion strategies and applies them against a reproduction of a recent, not previously evasion tested, detection system and finds that it is susceptible to various evasion techniques. Additionally, the produced detector is experimentally trained with a combination of the standard data and the recently published CIC-Evasive-PDFMal2022 dataset which contains malware samples which display evasive properties. The evasive-trained detector is tested against the same set of evasion attacks. The results of the two detectors are compared, concluding that supplementing the training data with evasive samples results in a more evasion resilient detector.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-315067\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xvii,95\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": \"Malware Analysis; Malicious PDF; Malware Detection; Machine Learning; Evasion; Analys av skadlig programvara; Skadlig PDF; Detektion av skadlig programvara; Maskininl\\u00e4rning; Undanflykt\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-30T12:02:31.429+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-29T14:36:36.880+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-30T12:02:31.470+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-315067\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": \"Stockholm\", \"publisher\": \"KTH Royal Institute of Technology\", \"total_pages\": 112.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511768\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2007]]}, \"title\": \"Increasing Accuracy of Location Determination : Exploiting Phase Change Reconstruction and Timing Measurements\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Ji\", \"given\": \"Lin\", \"localId\": \"u1jkuuvo\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Smith\", \"given\": \"Mark T.\", \"localId\": \"u18xiviu\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The thesis deals with improving location determination when using time of flight of radio signals to determine the location of a radiator. The goal of this project is to enhance an existing wireless data access point to perform an accurate measurement of the time of arrival of a data signal from a transmitter, and to combine this information with information from additional wireless data access points to determine the location of the transmitter.\\nThere have been a number of earlier efforts in indoor location determination system using different technologies. Many of which used signal strength analysis and they have low tolerance to moving obstacles such as humans, which frequently are the most usual dynamic obstacles in indoors. In this thesis, the proposed solution utilizes time stamping and sample correlation to utilize properties of the signal waveform, which has not previously been examined by researchers other than the examiner and advisor.\\nThe main contribution of the project is a detailed analysis and design of a solution, as well as a comparison with other potential solutions. The main purpose of this solution is to increase the timing accuracy to below the duration of a single symbol. The wireless device that has been analyzed implements the IEEE 802.11b protocol. Several investigations have been done to determine the best way of extracting information from the 802.11b data frame and symbol sequence; here we utilize a correlator to determine the time of arrival of a specific sequence of symbols in a data frame. The time stamping of a stream of samples has been implemented in an Altera FPGA to get a deterministic computation time.\\nInstead of decoding the incoming I&amp;Q signals and mapping them to bits, the correlator is used to detect the unique sequence containing PSK encoded and Barker code spread scrambled ones , as this sequence always appears at the start of each data frame. The advantage of this approach is that using of samples of the waveform instead of bits gives a significant enhancement in timing resolution.\\nThe design documents of this work include detailed descriptions, simulations, and plots. A number of simulations have been done to show the timing accuracy and standard deviation, as well as comparisons with several different approaches. Several potential optimizations have also been discussed in the report.\\nSimulation code for MATLAB and implementation code for the FPGA has been included in appendices in the end of this thesis.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91993\", \"number-of-pages\": \"50\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"kth.se COS/CCS 2007-14\", \"keyword\": \"IEEE 802.11b; Correlation; Time stamping; FPGA; PSK; IEEE 802.11b; korrelation; Tidst\\u00e4mpel; FPGA; PSK\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T13:41:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T12:33:13.202+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:14:59.697+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91993\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 50.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:508801\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2010]]}, \"title\": \"Indoor Location Detection using WLAN\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Luo\", \"given\": \"Anqi\", \"localId\": \"u1cyyzn2\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Ge\", \"given\": \"Lei\", \"localId\": \"u15qrfun\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The thesis seeks to improve the accuracy of indoor wireless local area network (WLAN) location detection. The main task of the project is the design and analysis of a solution, which utilizes the packets which are already emitted by WLAN devices. The system consists of a signal receiver and signal processing. The positioning system does not transmit, thus the detection is completely passive. The result of measurements on received frames is used to calculate the WLAN transmitter's position. It does not require any transmissions, thus the detection is completely passive. The result of the measurements can be used to calculate the WLAN transmitter\\u2019s position.\\nLocation systems are more and more viewed as a necessary element of a WLAN system. Positioning accuracy is the most important issue in location system, especial in the indoor WLAN location detection. Indoor location systems are affected by indoor environment both due to multi-path and man-made effects. To resist these problems, we introduce a way to detect the arrival of the first instance of the signal by detecting the signal header. In our experiment, we timestamp the arrival of an IEEE 802.11b header. In our prototype the logic necessary to do this is implemented in an FPGA, specifically that of the Ettus Research USRP. The additional logic is quite small and might easily be added to the receiver in an access point, thus reducing the deployment cost of a location system in a real network.\\nThe proposed solution was experimentally verified. From our experiments, the detection works without requiring any changes to the hardware or software of the mobile device. By exploiting existing IEEE 802.11b transmissions the cost and difficulty of deployment is simplified due to the wide usage of IEEE 802.11b in mobile devices. Additionally, the preamble has good correlation properties making it is easy to detect the arrival of a IEEE 802.11frame. Our implementation is based upon open source hardware and software making it possible to implement this solution. A relatively low cost FPGA can be used as the correlation and timestamp circuit is rather simple (in terms of numbers of gates), making this solution feasible for commercial implementation. The method, implementation, testing, and analysis are presented in detail in the thesis.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91200\", \"number-of-pages\": \"68\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2009:209\", \"keyword\": \"WLAN; location detection accuracy; arrival signal and processing\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-11T13:08:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-09T15:03:48.435+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:28:48.072+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91200\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 68.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:861838\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2015]]}, \"title\": \"Indoor Positioning System based on Bluetooth Low Energy for Blind or Visually Impaired Users : Running on a smartphone\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Ge\", \"given\": \"Tengqingqing\", \"localId\": \"u1821p55\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Arfwedson\", \"given\": \"Henrik\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Sweden Connectivity AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Blind and visually impaired (BVI) users desire an indoor navigation tool that is inexpensive, convenient, and reliable.

Thus, one focus of this thesis is to improve the performance of an indoor positioning systems running on smartphones, as compared to existing systems. Another focus is to customize this indoor positioning system specifically for BVI users.\\u00a0 The proposed indoor positioning system is based upon Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). It consists of two parts: BLE beacons deployed in the user\\u2019s environment and an Android phone which calculates its position and provides navigation assistance by audio and vibration.Two versions of the positioning software were developed based on different algorithms. One version uses a hybrid technique combining triangulation and fingerprinting. This version achieves a positioning accuracy of 1.83 meter, and volunteers (blind-folded sighted people) took on average 91.7 seconds to complete a complex 12-meter route. The other version uses a proximity algorithm, thus it does not give as accurate positioning results. With this algorithm, a blind user was able to finish a route of 115 meters consisting of two different floors in a building including entering/exiting an elevator and multiple office doors in 4 minutes 48 seconds. The blind user found the product to be helpful and user-friendly.Finally, we draw the conclusion that a smartphone can be a good platform for a BVI navigation tool, under the condition that the algorithm is proximity based and navigation utilizes a priori information about the environment. Another insight we gained is that we should put beacons on braille signs so that blind people can find them by using the navigation app.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-175668\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii.48\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2015:230\", \"keyword\": \"RSSI-based indoor positioning; Bluetooth; smartphone; blind and visually impaired; RSSI-baserade inomhuspositionering; Bluetooth; smartphone; blinda och synskadade\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-10-19T17:33:03.836+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-10-19T13:58:12.624+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T12:06:13.760+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-175668\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 61.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511851\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2007]]}, \"title\": \"Indoor Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) : Measurement and Modeling from a user perspective\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Zandieh\", \"given\": \"Behdis\", \"localId\": \"u1u7n96l\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"If we had detailed wireless local area network (WLAN) coverage maps, both staff and equipment could be used more efficiently, for example, less time would be spent searching for connectivity.

This rapid adoption is not comparable in any other technology. Additionally, this has meant that these users have (at least some of the time) the possibility of connectivity to others and to remote services (advanced data and voice services, such as video conferences, mobile TV, navigation, and location services). Increasingly there is no longer a clear boundary between the wide area cellular network and Internet services, as the wide area cellular network is evolving from circuit switched based technologies to an IP based system; hence these wide area cellular systems are simply becoming part of the Internet. This evolution has become a challenge for the telecommunication operators, who have been used to completely controlling their network services and billing. In an attempt to maintain this traditional role for telecommunication operators, telecommunication vendors have introduced the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). A system designed to enable telecommunication operators to be able to bill the user for all of the different services accessed through the wide area cellular network. The goal of such a system is to prevent the telecommunication operators from becoming a \\\"bit pipe\\\" (i.e., simply providing \\\"commodity priced\\\" connectivity). Another relevant change that has direct impact upon this project is the role of mobile handsets as gateways between sensor networks and other networks (especially the wide area cellular networks or Internet). This has lead to integrated solutions, such as the smart house concept, mobile health monitoring, and others.\\nThis thesis project is a collaboration between Ericsson Research and SUUNTO, in which we have implemented a system for monitoring a user\\u2019s heart rate via IMS. The system (has a special focus on sports activities, but it could easily be adapted for health care) is based on internetworking sensor networks, specifically a heart rate belt that transmits data wirelessly, with the IMS network through a mobile phone or a PC. The implemented service runs on top of the SIP Presence service. This project examines two alternatives. The first is a mobile scenario, in which a person is jogging outdoors, in this setting the sensor node communicates via the person\\u2019s mobile phone, through the IMS network to a monitoring application. The second scenario is more fixed; such as a gym environment, where the sensor node communicates with a personal computer which in turn publishes the data via IMS. Once the data has been published to the Presence and group management sever, an application server subscribed to the athlete\\u2019s Presence service will be notified. The people interested in viewing this data will be able to see it through any web-browser. It will even be possible to archive, and download the data for later use by other applications.\\nThe system is not optimized yet for a truly real-time communication, as the Presence service does not offer this as other technologies (RTP, SRTP or XMPP) do. There is a big delay difference between the mobile and the fixed solution. We can say that the fixed solution is almost a real-time system for transmitting low frequency data as heart rate information. This project is a first approach to a final high performance system.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91678\", \"number-of-pages\": \"112\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2008-22\", \"keyword\": \"IP Multimedia Subsystems; Presence service; sensor networks; heart rate monitor\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-20T10:31:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-19T16:29:14.849+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:19:39.257+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91678\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 112.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:514741\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2004]]}, \"title\": \"Interactions of Vertical Handoffs with 802.11b wireless LANs : Handoff Policy\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Mola\", \"given\": \"Guilo\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Nomadic computing aims to be a leading short term revolution in the Internet, however to succeed in this the infrastructure, the protocols, the handoff mechanisms have to be designed and implemented to provide mobile computing with both reliability and transparency.A good deal of the work is addressed by mobile IP itself, but addressing wireless diversity is perhaps the most important next step. Many different wireless technologies are available; while one technology might provide wide coverage, another provides higher bandwidth, but can only be deployed locally, even uni-directional ad-hoc links can be used to carry IP traffic. To take full advantage of the potential infrastructure, a mobile device, with multiple network interfaces, should be able to dynamically switch from one link technology to another; hopefully totally transparently to the user. Moreover, having multiple interfaces allows the device to choose, each time a new connection is established, which interface to select to route the datagrams through, based on the type of service desired.In this thesis a possible solution is presented, involving both vertical handoff optimization and policy management.

The demand for convenient financial products or services is a crucial factor in why innovative developers want to incorporate mobile money into existing financial products/services. The goal is to provide convenient financial services that enable customers to quickly send and receive money between two mobile payment platforms.The Swedish blockchain company, Centiglobe, is searching for a system whereby payments can be made conveniently between two mobile payment platforms, specifically Alipay and M PESA. This thesis sought to develop such a system by utilizing the application programming interfaces (APIs) (provided by Alipay and M PESA) coupled with Centiglobe\\u2019s blockchain to facilitate payments between an Alipay user and an M PESA user.Solving this problem began with an initial literature study of previous work related to this topic and reading the extensive API documentation provided by Alipay and Daraja Safaricom (the developers of M PESA). Next, a flowchart was created and used as a guide throughout the development of the system. Testing the system entailed integration testing. The performance of the system was determined by measuring the execution time to make a cross system payment.A one-way transfer system was developed, as Alipay users can make a payment to M PESA users but not the reverse. The results of the integration testing shows that the system is a feasible solution. The execution time of a payment shows that it is relatively quick (~9.1 seconds); thus the performance is adequate.The conclusion is that this system is a viable solution for incorporating Alipay and M PESA as mobile payment services. Moreover, the system partially facilitates person-to-person payments between them \\u2013 subject to the limitations of the Alipay API.

Despite situations and technologies being diverse, a well designed optimized RAN solution must adapt itself to the existing networking technologies, both with regard to legacy core networks and modern telecommunication networks in order to produce the best network which is possible subject to many constraints. There is a misconception in technical circles that an optimized internet protocol (IP) enabled RAN architecture is more theoretical than practical. On the contrary, the aforesaid is highly dependent on the technology used. Packet optimized IP- GSM Radio Access Network (GRAN) architecture is proposed in this thesis, it uses Internet Protocol (IP) rather than proprietary protocols for communication between Base Transceiver Stations (BTS), Base Station Controllers (BSC), and the Network Switching Subsystem (NSS). This architecture must deliver carrier-grade mobility, scalability, and reliability; while being optimized for efficient roaming, routing and backhauling from remote service areas. In a geographic arena that spans across the globe, classical circuit-switched networks are not cost efficient due to their integrated call control (signaling) and switching architecture. A solution to this may be soft-switching which separates the call control (Media Gateway Controller (MGC)) and switching (Media Gateway (MG)) into separate nodes. This methodology would fundamentally change the way circuit-switched services, such as traditional voice telephony, are handled. For a service provider this enables a much more efficient network, because it allows optimized equipment location for voice termination into other carrier networks. Co-location of media gateways with satellite ground stations enables local termination to the public switched telephone network (PSTN), thus offloading a great deal of the traffic from the backhaul transmission network of the mobile operator. This thesis adopts soft-switching as part of the call routing processes. The thesis considers the problem of transporting voice and signaling from-to the remote service areas, efficient routing and backhaul to the location of most suitable operator\\u2019s point of presence. The thesis explores an alternative which uses a packet switched backbone (e.g. IP based) to transport the media as close (geographically) to the dialed party as possible before terminating it at the PSTN network, thus achieving optimal routing of voice and signaling. Considering the aforesaid, the thesis describes a detailed network architecture and an operational system prototype for maritime GSM network deployment, as a befitting and challenging example of remote service area.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91940\", \"number-of-pages\": \"136\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2007-24\", \"keyword\": \"IP backbones; radio access networks; call routing; All-IP networks\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T14:16:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-22T16:39:14.648+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:15:29.857+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91940\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 136.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:541148\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1997]]}, \"title\": \"Internet Protocol Secirity\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Fujita\", \"given\": \"Lie\", \"localId\": \"u1hip3s8\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}, {\"family\": \"K\\u00f6rling (nee Beije)\", \"given\": \"Madeleine\", \"localId\": \"u1pdx3y7\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"K\\u00f6rling\", \"given\": \"Martin\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Radio Systems AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This paper gives an overview of the architecture and design of IPSec.

Thepurpose of Reliable Internet Stream Transport (RIST) and Secure Reliable Transport (SRT) is tohave all vendors of broadcasting equipment support an interoperable way of communication. Thelack of interoperability locks consumers into one particular vendor\\u2019s family of products - most oftenthis equipment only supports a proprietary technology. Interoperability creates a more competitivemarket space which benefits consumers and gives vendors an incentive to be more innovative intheir solutions.The purpose of this thesis is to assess the performance of these protocols by comparing theirperformance to a proprietary solution (named \\u00d6\\u00d6\\u00d6 in this thesis and seen as an establishedsolution in the industry). The challenge is to test these protocols in a lab environment, but have theresults represent real-world use. For this, a large subset of samples is needed along with samplesmeasured over a long period. This sampling was made possible by writing a script which automatesthe sampling process.The results indicate that the versions of RIST and SRT tested in this thesis to some extentcompare well to the selected established protocol (\\u00d6\\u00d6\\u00d6). In many scenarios, SRT even did muchbetter, mainly when a line with a single feed was tested.

Many of the disadvantages of current road systems and vehicles can be removed in the future by using appropriate information and communication technology.A disadvantage that has been considered to be a major problem for many years is the fossil fuel-consumption of vehicles. Hybrid-cars and all-electric cars are being developed to reduce the use of fossil-based fuels. Since it could take a long time for these new types of vehicles to replace vehicles currently using internal combustion engines, development must also seek to improve current vehicles. Fuel-savings and safety are two major aspects that researchers and vehicle manufacturers are trying to address.One approach that provides fuel-savings is driving in a convoy. Both Scania and Volvo are currently developing this approach. They aim to achieve the same goal, but in two different ways - since they do not build upon the exact same concepts. Scania is a major manufacturer of trucks and buses, while Volvo is a major manufacturer of trucks, buses, and cars. Both are seeking to improve the fuel-savings for trucks and busses, but Volvo is also seeking to improve fuel-savings for cars.Unfortunately, with every solution are new problems. Convoy driving brings advantages, but appropriate communication between the vehicles of the convoy and those seeking to join a convoy is necessary for this approach to work well. This is particularly challenging as these vehicles are in moving while communicating. For this reason, the communication needs to utilize wireless links.This thesis shows in more detail how the inter-vehicle communication works using Wi-Fi and why this is a good media to use when driving a convoy. The testing of Wi-Fi between two driving vehicles and in implementation of two model vehicles shows another perspective of Wi-Fi than today\\u2019s use of it.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-147916\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xi,91\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2014:96\", \"keyword\": \"IT-system; fuel savings; convoy; Scania; Volvo; wireless communication; Wi-Fi; model vehicles; IT-system; Minskad br\\u00e4nslef\\u00f6rbrukning; F\\u00f6rb\\u00e4ttrad br\\u00e4nslebesparing; Konvoj; Scania; Volvo; Tr\\u00e5dl\\u00f6s kommunikation; Wi-Fi; modellbilar\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-07-08T13:53:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-07-08T11:11:23.853+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T19:21:14.188+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-147916\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 102.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1692921\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2022]]}, \"title\": \"Investigating differences in performance between monolithic and serverless based architectures\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Manousian\", \"given\": \"Jonathan\", \"localId\": \"u1bcww0i\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879223\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r elektroteknik och datavetenskap (EECS)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Mushtaq\", \"given\": \"Wafaa\", \"localId\": \"u15x5byv\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879223\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r elektroteknik och datavetenskap (EECS)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"van der Meulen\", \"given\": \"Peter\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Knightec\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"With the growth of cloud computing, various delivery models have emerged to attract developers looking for scalable and cost-effective infrastructures for their software. Traditionally, applications are developed as a monolith with one single codebase repository, and they are easily deployed; for example as Platform as a Service (PaaS). However, monolithic applications have received criticism for inefficient resource handling when deployed on the cloud; therefore, new delivery models have been introduced as alternatives. Recent research points towards Function as a Service (FaaS) to potentially solve the issue of inefficient resource handling and, therefore, reduce costs. Furthermore, since multiple distinct development strategies and delivery models exist, it becomes increasingly important to choose the right strategy from the beginning since migrating to another development strategy or deployment model in the future is rather expensive. This thesis load tests monolithic and serverless applications to determine which development approach best suits performance, scalability, and cost requirements.The findings obtained showed that an application implemented with a serverless architecture can be a better strategy if the application needs to be able to handle a sudden large up-scaling. Otherwise, both architectures showed similar results to stable workloads. Regarding costs, the serverless architecture optimized costs on a smaller scale but further analysis showed that it can surpass the costs of a monolithic architecture if it surpasses a threshold of requests per month.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-317043\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xvii,63\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2022:248\", \"keyword\": \"Cloud; Serverless; Monolithic; Load testing; Function as a service; Molnet; Serverl\\u00f6s; Monolitisk; belastningstesning; Function as a service\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-09-09T13:07:13.550+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-09-05T11:12:24.132+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-09-09T13:07:13.586+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-317043\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": \"Stockholm\", \"publisher\": \"KTH Royal Institute of Technology\", \"total_pages\": 80.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:530930\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1998]]}, \"title\": \"Investigation and Prototyping of a web based manager in a GSM SIM Application Platform\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Chabouni (nee Talbi)\", \"given\": \"Sami\", \"localId\": \"u19ke1dt\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}, {\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Almgren\", \"given\": \"Fredrik\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"AU-System\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The growing need for communication in the world has increased the use of telephony and has therefore led to several technical innovations and improvements in the field of telecommunications. As countries develop their infrastructure new ways of communicating arise. But the technical innovations do not completely guide the evolution of the infrastructure. Many times, the way people act, i.e., their mentality and traditions, decides how to invest in the infrastructure. As basic infrastructure is being built in some developing countries, others come up with new revolutionary solutions to replace old infrastructure and, for some developing countries the question arises whether to continue to invest several hundreds of millions of dollars in traditional telephony wiring. The cellular technique is revolutionary enough to be applied in countries that haven\\u2019t yet built a telephony network covering an adequate area of the country. In these countries, investments might therefore be focused on the cellular technique, rather than continuing to invest in cable networking. Thus adapting cellular technology to a worldwide distribution is necessary when it comes to administration and subscriber payment. The communication providers meet administrative obstacles when it comes to telephony services for a large-scale distribution. Will the subscribers pay for the services we offer them?\\nUsing Subscriber Identity Modules (SIM) one way to solve this problem is to define a prepaid scheme. It is based on the fact that the subscriber uses a unique identifier to make a connection and is billed using this identifier. The service provider is free to choose if the subscriber is thrustworthy or not and thus must pay in advance for the services or billed retroactively. This general way of solving administration problems does not apply only to developing countries where retroactive billing isn\\u2019t a common tradition. It is equally applicable to industrial countries where some people are banned from credibility for a couple of years because they haven\\u2019t paid their bills in time, or just because they don\\u2019t have employment at the time of their subscription application.\\nTo be in possession of a telephone is everyone\\u2019s right in most of the industrialized countries.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-96501\", \"number-of-pages\": \"49\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": \"HTTP-server; CORBA Programming; Java\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-14T08:58:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-05T10:49:22.437+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:19:38.827+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-96501\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 49.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:871975\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2015]]}, \"title\": \"Investigation of a new integration test environment : Facilitating offline debugging of Hardware-in-the-Loop\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Yang\", \"given\": \"Dekun\", \"localId\": \"u1zms893\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Gustafsson\", \"given\": \"Thomas\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Scania\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Advanced automatic testing is very important in development and research within the vehicle industry. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems give the ability to validate Electronic Control Units (ECUs) based on software simulation without gathering all of the physical hardware. This enables testing by providing inputs and examining the corresponding outputs of the ECUs in a simpler and safer way than in traditional physical testing. HIL offers the advantage that we can verify and validate the functions of ECUs prior to full-scale hardware production.On the contrary, because HIL systems are normally released as general-purpose test beds, it takes time to embed them into the current system. Additionally, the question of how to fill the gap between the HIL and the test environment is even more critical when the test bed is expected to be used for a long period of time without modifications. Furthermore, HIL systems are precious. It is not practical and will be considered as a waste of resource if it is used exclusively by testers. Scania\\u2019s RESI group uses Client-Server architecture to make it more flexible. The HIL system is hosted at server side while the testers operate it at client side. This architecture enables different implementations of client and server as long as a same protocol is applied, but this still does not solve the problem that the HIL is not always accessible when the testers want to debug their scripts. The testers want to find a solution to achieve this goal offline (without servers).To solve the problem, we first investigated which programming languages are used in the industry. Without doubt, there is no dominant language that ideally suits all situations, so secondly, we developed a new test environment. The new environment including \\u201cDummy Mode\\u201d and \\u201cMat Mode\\u201d is able to provide script validation service on basic and logic levels without servers. The result shows the Dummy mode is able to reach a higher detection rate (99.3%) on simple errors comparing to the current environment (81.3%). By reproducing and reusing the result of HIL system, Mat mode is able to identify logic errors and provide better assistance when the logic errors are found. In general, the proposed environment is able to show a better way of using HIL which makes the whole system more efficient and productive.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-177199\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,50\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2015:236\", \"keyword\": \"Hardware in the Loop; test environment; Python; declarative test script; imperative test script; Simulink; MATLAB; Hardware In the Loop; Testmilj\\u00f6; Python; Deklarativ programmering; Imperativ programmering; Simulink; MATLAB\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-12-08T13:01:00.863+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-11-17T13:29:53.850+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T11:41:47.965+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-177199\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 63.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:508254\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2010]]}, \"title\": \"Investigation of home router security\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Karamanos\", \"given\": \"Emmanouil\", \"localId\": \"u1pzp7gl\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Seifert\", \"given\": \"Jean-Pierre\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Technische Universit\\u00e4t Berlin\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Home routers are common in every household that has some kind of Internet connectivity.

These applications can also be combined with other sensors and actuators to produce monitoring systems that can give facilities' operators \\\"telepresence\\\" throughout a facility. To be able to computationally interpret movement or patterns in an image it is imperative to investigate the application of this technology.The research conducted at Xylem has focused on a very specific problem: How can pattern recognition be utilized to dynamically determine the volume and depth of water in a sump at a pumping station. The equipment currently used to determine the water level depends upon being either below or alongside the water's surface, this puts the equipment under great stress due to the nature of a pumping station. Xylem is one of the leading global water technology companies, hence sewage-pumps are one of its main products. The main equipment utilized in this thesis project consists of a camera attached to the interior at the top of the sump in a pumping station connected to a computer.The software developed includes a simple graphical user interface (GUI). This GUI was implemented in C# and is designed to continuously collect data from a camera for subsequent analysis. Our algorithm utilizes anti-correlation between many images taken during a short interval to determine the actual water level. The known dimensions of the sump are then used to calculate the volume of water.Most of the depth values produced by our software were correct and we were able to correctly estimate the water level with an error of less than 4 cm, this corresponds to a volume error of 62 liters for a 140 cm wide sump. Our algorithm was able to monitor the depth over time inside a pumping station in a simulated live environment.\\u00a0 This accuracy is obtained with a time window of 1 second. The results of this system are important because it shows that it is possible to use a camera to measure water depth. This provides pump owners and operators with valuable information regarding the current state of the pump, both in terms of current water depth and an image of possible anomalies such as the presence of foreign objects in the sump.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-149256\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xi,95\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2014:115\", \"keyword\": \"Pattern recognition; water level estimation; m\\u00f6nsterigenk\\u00e4nning; vattenniv\\u00e5 uppskattning\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-08-19T08:50:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-08-18T15:47:39.257+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T19:03:15.555+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-149256\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 106.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:510473\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2009]]}, \"title\": \"IP Multimedia for Municipalities : The supporting architecture\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Peterstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Dan\", \"localId\": \"u1cwceql\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Ljungberg\", \"given\": \"Per\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Fiber deployment is becoming popular and is seen as a way to increase a community\\u2019s attractiveness to new inhabitants and companies.

It is possibly the most important one as it has gained more than 3 millions users in approximately 2 years time. In contrast, Minisip is a non-commercial implementation of SIP developed by students at KTH. These programs are based on different architectures. While Skype is said to be based on a peer-to-peer protocol, Minisip utilized the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) protocol.The aim of this thesis was to evaluate these two VoIP programs not only in terms of development, but also in terms of the quality of service and user perceived voice quality. The study of efficiency, usability, and installation of both are also in the scope of this thesis. The devices used for the evaluation included a HP iPAQ 5550, two PCs running in RedHat Linux 9, and a laptop running Microsoft Windows XP.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92288\", \"number-of-pages\": \"114\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-IMIT-LCN.

This report describes how to control and monitor home appliances over IPv6 by using existing home automation hardware and an Internet connected gateway.\\nThere are many commercial home automation systems available. However, these are often proprietary and/or designed for limited use. This project seeks to pave the way for IP-enabling home appliances, making such devices part of the Internet. Therefore, these devices can individually be controlled both from within the home and remotely. Internet enabling each of these devices eliminates the need for special Internet connected control units, simplifying home automation and hopefully giving yet another incentive to deploy IPv6 on a larger scale. The practical goal of this project has been to create a virtual, but practically usable, IPv6 home automation system. This has been done using existing simple home automation hardware tied to a gateway relaying uniquely addressed IPv6 command messages to the appropriate device. This gateway's only function will be to translate IPv6 commands to whatever interface the device being controlled is using (this includes translating to and from the appropriate link and physical layers). Using this platform, new applications can be created by enabling the devices to interact without relying on a central control node.

This is a consequence of several ongoing changes of the Internet. Different regions of the world are in different phases of their rollout of IPv6, making intercommunication increasingly challenging. Copyright legislation has caught up with ICT technology, but differences in licensing agreements may very from nation to nation which often hinders content being accessed beyond borders. Finally, several high-profile government attempts have been made to enforce stringent censorship of data.Therefore, we believe that a demand exists for simple consumer-oriented technologies for proxying and tunneling data between separate regions of the Internet. Furthermore, we believe that this demand will increase dramatically during the coming years. A key success factor for this next generation of proxies will be the ability to handle multicast IPv6 packets, as these packets represent the most probable distribution method for IPTV in the future.This thesis examines the challenges presented by IPv6 multicast-routing in the context of constructing a proxy. It also presents a best-practice solution to the problem of designing, implementing, and utilizing such a proxy. The thesis also contains a review of current IPv6 multicast routing technology. Several implementations are benchmarked against each other, with the goal of building a prototype for a consumer-oriented IPv6 multicast proxy. The prototype is presented and was tested. These tests demonstrate the functionality of the prototype proxy and reveal areas where the prototype could be improved.

One of the use cases of visualization is to graphically represent and compare simulation results. At Ericsson Research, a visualization platform, based on JavaFX 2 is used to visualize simulation results. Three configuration files are required in order to create an application based on the visualization tool: XML, FXML, and CSS.The current problem is that, in order to set up a visualization application, the three configuration files must be written by hand which is a very tedious task. The purpose of this study is to reduce the amount of work which is required to construct a visualization application by providing a serialization function which makes it possible to save the layout (FXML) of the application at run-time based solely on the scene graph.In this master\\u2019s thesis, possible frameworks that might ease the implementation of a generic FXML serialization have been investigated and the most promising alternative according to a number of evaluation metrics has been identified. Then, using a design science research method, an algorithm is proposed which is capable of generic object/bean serialization to FXML based on a number of features or requirements. Finally, the implementation results are evaluated through a set of test cases. The evaluation is composed of an analysis of the serialization results &amp; tests and a comparison of the expected result and the actual results using unit testing and test coverage measurements.Evaluation results for each serialization function show that the results of the serialization are similar to the original files and hence the proposed algorithm provides the desired serialization functionality for the specific features of FXML needed for this platform, provided that the tests considered every aspect of the serialization functionality.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-131221\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,74\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:232\", \"keyword\": \"Scene graph; Java bean; JavaFX; FXML; serialization; reflection; introspection; DOM; tree traversal; scengraf; Java-b\\u00f6nor; JavaFX; FXML; serialisering; reflection; introspection; DOM; tr\\u00e4d traversering\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-10-10T07:34:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-10-09T17:16:16.686+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T22:50:01.618+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-131221\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 87.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:224297\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2009]]}, \"title\": \"Jitter Management in Circuit Switched Voice over HSPA Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Song\", \"given\": \"Ge\", \"affiliation\": []}], \"supervisor\": null, \"abstract\": \"When a shared channel or packet switched network is used for transmission (e.g.WLAN, HSPA (Turbo-3G), LTE (4G)), it introduces variance in the delay of packets. Thisvariance is called jitter. This jitter can lead to significant degradation of quality inreal-time services if it is not properly handled.\\nHigh Speed Packet Access (HSPA) is an extension to the third Generation W-CDMAcellular network that provides significantly increased bandwidth and network capacity byintroducing a High Speed-Downlink Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) for downlink and anEnhanced-Dedicated Channel (E-DCH) for uplink. Both HS-DSCH and E-DCH usere-transmissions in order to ensure a low block error rate, as a result jitter is induced inboth channels. Moreover, HS-DSCH also uses channel dependent scheduling betweenusers adding additional jitter.\\nSince HSPA uses IP and the voice service is provided by voice over IP (VoIP), jittermanagement is performed at the destination end-point. However, 3GPP has also specifiedtransportation of circuit switched voice over HSPA (CSoHS), where jitter managementneeds to be performed separately, at both the entry point to the core network and in thereceiving end-point as jitter is introduced both in the uplink and downlink.\\nThis report studies CSoHS, with a focus on its delay and jitter characteristics. Itintroduces two schemes for jitter management: a fixed jitter buffer and an adaptive jitterbuffer. These jitter buffer designs are evaluated mainly by looking at the jitter loss (i.e.,the proportion of packets that have to be discarded because they exceed the maximumpermitted jitter) and the buffering time. The results show that the adaptive jitter buffer canachieve better performance in balancing the trade-off between jitter loss and bufferingdelay when dealing with various network conditions. In contrast, the fix jitter buffer is notcapable of tracking variations in the network conditions, as the performance of the fixedjitter buffer is determined solely by the configuration of the initial buffer level. Theadaptive jitter buffer is able to consistently provide equal or better quality of service thanthe fixed jitter buffer.i\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-10673\", \"number-of-pages\": \"viii, 65\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2009-06-17T13:53:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2009-06-17T13:41:00.409+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-25T06:57:57.391+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-10673\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 73.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:514748\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2003]]}, \"title\": \"Key Agreement for Secure Voice over IP\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Bilien\", \"given\": \"Johan\", \"localId\": \"u1ai4xjb\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Eliasson\", \"given\": \"Erik\", \"localId\": \"u130e4ad\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Vatn\", \"given\": \"Jon-Olov\", \"localId\": \"u1op1pjc\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This thesis reviews the usual properties and requirements for key agreement protocols.

For sound, digital music enables digital distribution, ease of sharing, and large amounts of storage. But, despite the recent efforts by Internet companies and publishers, the book industry has resisted success in the digital era.Today, new technologies enable us to distribute digital books. However, these digitised books are still represented in a traditional: as text and static images. However, our project is based on the believe that ones reading experience can evolve and benefit from current technology.The \\\"Leaf\\\" project's main objective is to create an electronic publication distribution platform that can equally satisfy publishers, writers, and readers. The project will create an environment to distribute digital publications that support more advanced technologies, providing in the future something beyond text and static images to the reader.This document describes the different aspects of design of an information technology infrastructure designed to stream electronic publications. This part of the \\\"Leaf\\\" projects aims to describe the necessary information technology infrastructure needed as an electronic publication distribution platform. The main purpose of this infrastructure is to serve electronic publications on-line to readers; however, that is not the only objective for this infrastructure.

The Internet of Things describes a scenario where Internet connected devices are ubiquitous and even the smallest device has a connection to the Internet. Many of these devices will be running on constrained platforms with limited power and computing resources. Implementing protocols that are both secure and resource efficient is challenging. Current protocols have generally been designed for mains powered devices; hence, they are not optimized for running on constrained devices. The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a protocol for network communication specifically designed for constrained devices. This thesis project examines CoAP and presents an extension that adds authentication in a way that is suitable for constrained devices, with respect to minimizing resource use. The proposed solution has been compared and contrasted with other alternatives for authentication, particularly those alternatives used with CoAP. It has also been implemented in code and experimentally evaluated with regards to performance versus vanilla CoAP.The main goal of this project is to implement a lightweight authentication extension for CoAP to be deployed and evaluated on constrained devices. This extension, called Short Message Authentication ChecK (SMACK), can be used on devices that require a method for secure authentication of messages while using only limited power. The main goal of the extension is to protect against battery exhaustion and denial of sleep attacks. Other benefits are that the extension adds no additional overhead when compared with the packet structure described in the latest CoAP specification. Minimizing overhead is important since some constrained networks may only support low bandwidth communication.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-156185\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,54\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2014:136\", \"keyword\": \"Constrained Application Protocol; CoAP; Internet of Things; message authentication; constrained devices; Contiki; Short Message Authentication Check; SMACK; Constrained Application Protocol; CoAP; Internet of Things; meddelandeautentisering; begr\\u00e4nsade plattformar; Contiki; Short Message Authentication Check; SMACK\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-12-30T14:59:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-11-24T11:16:13.177+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T17:13:04.959+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-156185\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 67.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:530129\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1998]]}, \"title\": \"Linjelyssnare f\\u00f6r Gr\\u00e4nssnitt mot DECT-basestation\", \"language\": \"swe\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Ebrahimi\", \"given\": \"Hamid\", \"localId\": \"u1ojgvbm\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}, {\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Andersson\", \"given\": \"Lennart\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson (EBC)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"There purpose of this thesis was design and evaluate a device which would listen to the proprietary interface between a Private Automatic Branch Exchange (PBX) and a Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) basestation.

The data about the amount of traffic was measured using a real-time tra\\ufb03c-monitoring tool from PacketLogic. Traffic from the monitored network to various destinations was captured and classified into 5 ring-wise locality levels in accordance with the traffic\\u2019s geographic destinations: traffic within Network North and traffic to the remainder of the North of Sweden, Sweden, Europe, and World.Parameters such as traffic patterns (e.g., traffic volume distribution, application usage, and application popularity) and user behavior (e.g., usage habits, user interests, etc.) at different geographic localities were studied in this project. As a result of a systematic and in-depth measurement and the fact that the number of content servers at the World, Europe, and Sweden levels are quite large, we recommend that an intelligent content distribution system be positioned at Level 1 localities in order to reduce the amount of duplicate traffic in the network and thereby removing this traffic load from the core network.The results of these measurements provide a temporal reference for ISPs of their present traffic and should allow them to better manage their network. However, due to certain circumstances the analysis was limited due to the set of available daily traffic traces. To provide a more trustworthy solution, a relatively longer-term, periodic, and seasonal traffic analysis could be done in the future based on the established measurement framework.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-107686\", \"number-of-pages\": \"53\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:302\", \"keyword\": \"Traffic Measurement; Geographical Locality; Traffic Pattern; User Behavior; Application Utilization; Internet Trafik; Geografiska Trafikdestinationer; Trafikm\\u00f6nster; Anv\\u00e4ndarbeteenden; Applikationer Popularitet\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-12-17T08:16:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-12-14T18:35:05.018+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T02:04:50.600+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-107686\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 53.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:515030\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2003]]}, \"title\": \"Location Aware Communication\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Eckerstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Johan\", \"localId\": \"u1nw6gc8\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Asplund\", \"given\": \"Lars-\\u00c5ke\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Columna AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Automotive telematic systems will be as common in future cars as ABS and airbags are in current cars.

About 60,000, licensed (age 15 and up, about 50%) and younger actively played soccer in Stockholm in 2005. That is roughly 24% of the total number of participants in sports activities in Stockholm\\u2019s district. There is a need for a location-based application (commonly abbreviated \\\"app\\\") to help people spontaneously meet for different sports activities.The app developed and analyzed in this thesis will address this need and assist potential participants in organizing sports activities, deciding to participate in these activities, make friends, etc. Not only large team sports will be considered, but sports done in pairs such as tennis and other sports as well that you do with others. Consider a person who has moved to a new city and wants to play football (soccer), but does not know people in this city. This app can help this person find others who would like to play in a quick and easy way by looking at a map and seeing where others would like to participate in this sport, for example at a particular soccer field, using location information concerning the potential participants and this specific field. Apps that use location information have become very common with the widespread use of smartphones. Such an app provides a location-based service.This thesis describes the design and implementation of an Android app with a location-based service and how to set up this app, what technology is needed to get the needed location information, and the programming language used. In addition, the thesis considers users\\u2019 needs and how the app caters to those needs. An analysis will be done of how well this app communicates with a database server as the number of users increases, scales. Performance and load on both the server and app will be considered. The performance will be analyzed to see how well it matches the users\\u2019 expectations.The app developed in this thesis will be for the Android platform and Apple's iOS (but the focus in the thesis is on the Android-version). This app will communicate with a database server running a Linux OS, an Apache HTTP server, a MySQL database, and using a PHP programming web infrastructure (such a setup of services is commonly called by the acronym LAMP). The app will connect to Facebook and Twitter to exchange information (however, that is outside the scope of this thesis).\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-160260\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,42\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2015:10\", \"keyword\": \"Location-based; application; app; service; Android; scales; database; server; LAMP; sports; Platsbaserad; application; app; tj\\u00e4nst; Android; skalar; databas; server; LAMP; sport\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-03-24T13:19:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-02-18T12:45:10.412+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T15:57:22.059+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-160260\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 55.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:513062\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2005]]}, \"title\": \"Low cost secure network connectivity for a municipal organization\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Gutti\", \"given\": \"Krishna\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Finnved\", \"given\": \"Johan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"AB STOKAB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) based on 802.11 technology were initially conceived with the aim of providing wireless connectivity to client devices in limited areas, such as office buildings, homes, etc. or in places where wires are too expensive to be placed. This \\u2018anywhere\\u2019 connectivity is said to have improved worker\\u2019s productivity by allowing one to work flexibly from various places besides one\\u2019s desk. Currently we are witnessing the growth of both public and private networks based on WLAN technology. Such hotspots are usually limited to the network owner\\u2019s premises such as her office, campus, etc. This limits the total coverage area of this network. It is often not economically feasible for a network access provider to install Access Points at all places that a network user might go. This has become a problem for many network access providers; a sensible solution would be to collectively address the problem by entering into roaming agreements as is already done by most Wide Area Wireless Network providers. Such operator specific roaming agreements can provide nearly continuous coverage over a much wider area such as an entire city. One of the goals of this project was to study potential cost effective technical solutions that provide WLAN access to City of Stockholm\\u2019s network based on 802.11 technologies; including evaluation from different technical aspects (e.g., capacity enhancements, improvements in handover latency, etc). Proper deployment and management strategies were also evaluated. Technologies permitting differentiated services for users, enabling provisioning of Voice over Wireless Local Area Network (VoWLAN) services and other interactive services were studied. Technologies for authentication, authorization and accounting were studied. Additionally technical means of providing secure access to the wireless network were investigated. Evaluation of architectures that allow inter-operator roaming were made.Today\\u2019s corporate users are increasingly mobile and there is a need to provide secure access to corporate data to these mobile users. The coverage offered by WLAN networks even with large roaming agreements would still have coverage gaps which can be reduced by relying on the 3G networks which are being widely deployed. Virtual Private Network technologies are successfully used for providing secure remote access to data and Mobile IP technology provides application persistence to mobile users even while switching between networks (e.g., WLAN to 3G). There is a need for them to co-exist in order to provide secure, mobile access to data. Such secure mobile access could also be provided without relying on the above, standardised solutions. A goal of this master\\u2019s thesis was to evaluate the technical solutions to enable such secure, mobile access to data. Current products were evaluated and a suggestion of suitable products for the City of Stockholm was given.The above solutions together would provide the City of Stockholm with secure wireless network connectivity[.]\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92266\", \"number-of-pages\": \"66\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-IMIT-LCN.

Thus, mobile network operators need to find a solution for how to support the growing amounts of traffic at fixed revenue per user. Similarly, the number of roaming users has increased, but according to recent European Union (EU) regulations, mobile network operators have to lower their charges for roaming to zero by June 2017. While this decrease in roaming charges will benefit European roaming users, mobile network operators have to cover their expenses for their own roaming subscribers, thus they have to find a way to lower their operational expenses (OPEX). Additionally, it is important for operators to consider how they might actually benefit from the removal of roaming charges.This project will focus on roaming in 4th generation (4G) mobile networks. A common roaming scenario would include three different networks: the Home Public Land Mobile Network (HPLMN) a transit network, and a Visited Public Land Mobile Network (VPLMN). Normally, both the signaling traffic and the media payloads traverse these networks, thus causing additional latencies and increasing OPEX. However, in recent years, a new mechanism, called local breakout (LBO), was introduced that can lower the costs of roaming and avoid unnecessary traffic while meeting a roaming user's needs.The goal of LBO is to decrease the operator's OPEX when supporting roaming subscribers. A secondary goal of LBO is to reduce the latencies experienced by roaming subscribers during their sessions. Achieving both of these goals will satisfy both operators and consumers.This thesis project analyzes Voice over Long Term Evolution roaming with the aim of presenting the various alternative architectures for Voice over LTE roaming, compare them in different scenarios, and evaluating them based on criteria defined during this project. The conclusion is that the best solution that is applicable to all the mobile network operators for all the possible roaming scenarios does not exist yet. The various VoLTE roaming architectures can be chosen by the mobile network providers according to their needs.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-200335\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiv, 52\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2017:1\", \"keyword\": \"Local breakout; RAVEL; S8HR; VoLTE roaming; Local breakout; RAVEL; S8HR; VoLTE roaming\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-02-01T13:51:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-02-01T13:51:56.559+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-27T03:37:22.314+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-200335\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 66.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:531073\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1998]]}, \"title\": \"Making the communication network aware of the user's location\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Jansson\", \"given\": \"Christian\", \"localId\": \"u1kx92jw\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Frisk\", \"given\": \"Claes\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ellemtel\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This thesis report discusses and summarises the concerns for making the communication network location aware.

These decentralized systems are preferable to centralized systems for many reasons, specifically they are more reliable and more resource efficient. Decentralized systems are more effective in the area of information management in the case when the data is distributed across multiple peers and maintained in a synchronized manner. This data synchronization is the main requirement for information management systems deployed in a decentralized environment, especially when data/information is needed for monitoring purposes or some dependent data artifacts rely upon this data. In order to ensure a consistent and cohesive synchronization of dependent/derived data in a decentralized environment, a dependency management system is needed.\\nIn a dependency management system, when one chunk of data relies on another piece of data, the resulting derived data artifacts can use a decentralized systems approach but must consider several critical issues, such as how the system behaves if any peer goes down, how the dependent data can be recalculated, and how the data which was stored on a failed peer can be recovered. In case of a churn (resulting from failing peers), how does the system adapt the transmission of data artifacts with respect to their access patterns and how does the system provide consistency management?\\nThe major focus of this thesis was to addresses the churn behavior issues and to suggest and evaluate potential solutions while ensuring a load balanced network, within the scope of a dependency information management system running in a decentralized network. Additionally, in peer-to-peer (P2P) algorithms, it is a very common assumption that all peers in the network have similar resources and capacities which is not true in real world networks. The peer\\u201fs characteristics can be quite different in actual P2P systems; as the peers may differ in available bandwidth, CPU load, available storage space, stability, etc. As a consequence, peers having low capacities are forced to handle the same computational load which the high capacity peers handle, resulting in poor overall system performance. In order to handle this situation, the concept of utility based replication is introduced in this thesis to avoid the assumption of peer equality, enabling efficient operation even in heterogeneous environments where the peers have different configurations. In addition, the proposed protocol assures a load balanced network while meeting the requirement for high data availability, thus keeping the distributed dependent data consistent and cohesive across the network. Furthermore, an implementation and evaluation in the PeerfactSim.KOM P2P simulator of an integrated dependency management framework, D4M, was done.\\nIn order to benchmark the implementation of proposed protocol, the performance and fairness tests were examined. A conclusion is that the proposed solution adds little overhead to the management of the data availability in a distributed data management systems despite using a heterogeneous P2P environment. Additionally, the results show that the various P2P clusters can be introduced in the network based on peer\\u201fs capabilities.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95220\", \"number-of-pages\": \"62\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:60\", \"keyword\": \"heterogeneous peer-to-peer networks; dependency management framework; p2p Replication protocol; Dynamic Distributed derived data management system(D4M); p2p churn\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-14T14:35:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-05-20T02:10:18.031+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:34:35.857+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95220\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 62.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:516834\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2000]]}, \"title\": \"MANETv6 : Mobile Ad hoc Networks with IPv6\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Jondring\", \"given\": \"Cecilia\", \"localId\": \"u1bfgion\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Stefanidis\", \"given\": \"Katerina\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Johansson\", \"given\": \"Per\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericssson Research, Switchlab\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Today\\u2019s Internet Protocol version 4, IPv4, has been in use since the early 1980\\u2019s and is now becoming obsolete in many ways. New networks and IP devices are constantly being attached to the Internet and the number of IP addresses is running out. The next generation Internet protocol, Internet protocol version 6 (IPv6), will allow for the continued expansion of the Internet and will replace IPv4 in the near future. Another reason for developing a new Internet protocol was to bring new functionality and higher performance into networking based on operational experience with IPv4.\\nMobile ad hoc networks are wireless, mobile networks that can be set up anywhere and anytime. Nodes in such a network can communicate beyond transmitter range by supporting multihop communication through IP routing. The network topology may change rapidly and therefore the routing functionality in an ad hoc network is different from that in an ordinary fixed IP network. Ad hoc networking can be applied in many situations, supporting applications, such as mobile conferencing outside the office. A stand-alone ad hoc network is useful in itself, but would be even more useful connected to the Internet.\\nIn this thesis we have investigated and analyzed how IPv6 may affect mobile ad hoc networking. Our focus has been on the IP address autoconfiguration of nodes in an ad hoc network and how the new features in IPv6 will enable a simpler way to provide Internet access to ad hoc networks. The purpose was to not use Mobile IPv6 in our solution. The solution could therefore be applied to all nodes, even to those not using Mobile IPv6. The existing solutions of how to connect an ad hoc network to the Internet are all based on Mobile IP.

At the same time, due to their decreasing price they are becoming more and more attractive and available to the average customer. This has lead to the development of many new applications for such portable electronic devices. Mobile devices tend to have increasing local resources in terms of memory/storage and CPU [2]. Despite these improvements in hardware attributes, there are still limitations that characterize these portable devices and which have not improved as quickly as the increase of the local computational power. These limitations mostly concern the network resources and battery power that are both still rather poor. Thus the main barriers for mobile nodes are network resources and limiting the power consumption of the device itself. Today, wireless networks provide limited reliability and less bandwidth than fixed networks. Moreover, all mobile nodes are highly energy dependent as they use batteries with a limited capacity. Additionally, roaming is a feature that increasingly must be supported for such wireless devices, as their physical portability leads to users to use them even as they move about. This may require the utilization of different wireless networks while the node is on the move. Therefore, for all the above reasons there is a demand for the development of intelligent mechanisms and techniques for optimizing the management of these limited resources, while exploiting the local resources, thus providing users with the best possible performance within the available resources.\\nAt the present, there are operating systems, such as the Symbian OS [22], specially designed for supporting advanced features in mobile computing. However, there is still development to be done. Moreover, although there are many new applications for mobile computing, they are not yet sophisticated enough to cope with changes in the wireless environment, these changes occur due to the node\\u2019s change in context. This creates a gap that should be filled by software between the applications and the operating system; this is frequently called middleware.

The Internet is a network of networks with a myriad of computer devices, including smartphones, game consoles (handheld/stationary), IP televisions, tablet computers, laptop computers, desktop computers, palmtop computers, etc.\\nThis network of computers flourishes because of careful planning and maintenance by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), backbone network operators, and others. An additional factor that enables the Internet to operate is the four logical layers of abstraction in the TCP/IP protocol stack. One of these layers is the layer responsible for the transfer of datagrams/packets from one host to another. This layer is known as the Internet Protocol (IP) layer. However, as originally conceived a 32 bit address was thought to be more than enough. The space of IP addresses was distributed among different regions rather disproportionately, driven largely by the numbers of addresses that were requested (ordered in time). Today after a series of inventions in the field (such as the world wide web) and a rapid growth in the number of devices that wish to connect to the Internet the available unassigned address space has largely been depleted.\\nRegions with large populations, but with few assigned blocks of IP addresses have begun to exhaust all their assigned addresses, while other regions face the same fate in a few months. The need for a larger address space was predicted years ago and the next generation addressing scheme was devised as part of the development of Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6). Countries such as China and India had few IPv4 addresses and they have been forced to transition to IPv6 rather quickly. Today a significant number of the users in these countries are unable to communicate over IPv4 networks. The purpose of this thesis project is to discuss the transition to IPv6 and the transition to this new addressing scheme. IPv6 provides a much larger address space, along with a number of additional improvements in comparison to the previous version of IP (i.e., IPv4). Despite the advantages of adopting IPv6, the incentive to transition is low amongst well established businesses, especially those in regions that received a considerable number of IPv4 addresses initially. Instead different techniques have been employed in these places to mitigate the problem of IPv4 address exhaustion. It is also probable that this reluctance is a way to keep competing businesses out of the market for a while longer. This thesis aims to facilitate the transition from IPv4 to IPv6.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-96355\", \"number-of-pages\": \"32\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:71\", \"keyword\": \"Internet; IPv6; IPv4; IPv6 deployment; IPv4 to IPv6 transition strategies; Mobile IPv6; Performance evaluation\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-14T10:59:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-02T02:19:01.920+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:21:44.386+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-96355\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 32.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:627307\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2013]]}, \"title\": \"Minding the spectrum gaps : First steps toward developing a distributed white space sensor grid for cognitive radios\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Lara Peinado\", \"given\": \"Javier\", \"localId\": \"u1733y14\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The idea that the radio spectrum is growing ever more scarce has become commonplace, and is being reinforced by the recent bidding wars among telecom operators. New wireless applications tend to be deployed in the relatively narrow unlicensed frequency bands, worsening the problem of interference for all users.\\u00a0 However, not all frequency bands are in use in every location all the time, creating temporal and spatial gaps (also known as white spaces) that cognitive radio systems aim to take advantage of. In order to achieve that, such systems need to be able to constantly scan large chunks of the radio spectrum to keep track of which frequency bands are locally available any given moment, thus allowing users to switch to one of these unoccupied frequency bands once the current band becomes unusable (or less useful). This requirement of wideband sensing capabilities often translates into the need to install specialized radio components, raising the costs of such systems, and is often at odds with the focus on monitoring the current band as is done by traditional wireless devices.The goal of this master\\u2019s thesis project is to simplify cognitive radio systems by shifting the wideband sensing functionality to a specialized and inexpensive embedded platforms that will act as a white space sensor, thus freeing cognitive radio users from this task and making it easier to integrate dynamic spectrum management techniques into existing systems. To do that a wireless sensor gateway platform developed by a previous master\\u2019s thesis has been repurposed as a prototype white space detector and tested against several wireless transmitters.\\u00a0 The aim is to develop a standalone platform that can be deployed all around an area to collect data that can be used to create a geographical map of the use of the spectrum. Such a system should require as little maintenance as possible, thus auto-update and self-configuring features have been implemented in the detector, as well as a simple scanning protocol that allows for remote configuration of the wideband sensing parameters. Furthermore, a basic server has been developed to aggregate and display the data provided by the different sensors.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-123548\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xv,58\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:102\", \"keyword\": \"cognitive radio; cooperative spectrum sensing; energy detector; kognitiv radio; kooperativa spektrum avk\\u00e4nning; energi detektor\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-06-11T14:17:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-06-11T14:02:32.402+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T00:09:39.335+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-123548\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 73.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:565706\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"MiniSIP as a Plug-in\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Arumugam Mathivanan\", \"given\": \"Arun\", \"localId\": \"u1qbtr2y\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Internet telephony has rapidly becoming an integral part of life. Due to its low incremental cost and the wide availability of voice over IP (VoIP) based services these services being used by nearly everyone. Today there are many VoIP applications available in the market, but most of them lack basic security features. Because people use VoIP services via public hotspots and shared local area networks these VoIP applications are vulnerable to attacks, such as eavesdropping. Today, there is a great need for VoIP applications with high quality security.MiniSIP is an open-source VoIP application platform, initially developed at KTH. High quality security has been a major focus of MiniSIP developments by several students, including the first public implementations of the secure real-time protocol (SRTP) and the Multimedia Key Exchange (MIKEY) protocol. MiniSIP implements secure end-to-end VoIP services. In addition, MiniSIP implements features such as dynamically choosing the most appropriate CODEC during a call, implementing calling policies, etc. However, it suffers from having a complicated GUI that requires the use of many libraries, rendering it both hard to build and hard support \\u2013 both of which make it unsuitable for commercial purposes.Web browser plug-ins are shared libraries that users install to extend the functionality of their browser. For example, a plug-in can be used to display content that the browser itself cannot display natively. For example, Adobe's reader plugin displays PDF files directly within the web browser. Real Network\\u2019s Streaming video player utilizes a browser plug-in to provide support for live video streaming within a web page. Adobe\\u2019s Flash player plugin is required to load or view any Flash contents \\u2013 such as video or animations.The goal of this thesis project is remove the problem of the existing MiniSIP GUIs by developing a Firefox browser plug-in for the MiniSIP application that will utilize a web-browser based GUI. The prototype that will be designed, implemented, and evaluated will implement an open-source VoIP application that is easy for a Firefox browser user to install and will be easy to use via a web interface. The long term goal is to facilitate an ordinary user to utilize VoIP communication via their web browser. A secondary goal is to re-use the code within MiniSIP, while using the web-browser to provide the GUI.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-104646\", \"number-of-pages\": \"45\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:247\", \"keyword\": \"VoIP; MiniSIP; Firefox plugin; web-browser; VoIP; MiniSIP; Firefox plugin; webbl\\u00e4sare\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-11-14T16:38:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-11-08T12:40:47.138+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T02:39:20.770+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-104646\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 45.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:519245\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"MIPMANET : Mobile IP for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"J\\u00f6nsson\", \"given\": \"Ulf\", \"localId\": \"u15mhiy5\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Alriksson\", \"given\": \"Fredrik\", \"localId\": \"u1m6jply\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Mobile ad hoc networking allows nodes to form temporary networks and communicate beyond transmitter range by supporting multihop communication through IP routing. Routing in such ten reactive, i.e., performed on-demand, as opposed to Internet routing that is proactive. As ad hoc networks are formed on a temporary basis, no assumptions are made about the IP addresses of the participating nodes; nodes may use any address. Because of these characteristics, it is not straightforward to connect an ad hoc network to the Internet. In this Master's thesis we have studied how an ad hoc network, in which on-demand routing is used and where nodes with arbitrary IP addresses may appear, can be connected to the Internet. Various ways of adapting Mobile IP to such an ad hoc network have also been explored. All this has resulted in the MIPMANET proposal.\\nMIPMANET provides Internet access by using Mobile IP with foreign agent care-of addresses and reverse tunneling. By using Mobile IP, nodes are routable regardless of which network they are currently located in and by using reverse tunneling the requirements on the ad hoc routing protocol in use are kept at a minimum. Also, by using an interworking unit between the foreign agent and the ad hoc network no modifications to Mobile IP have to be made outside of the ad hoc network. MIPMANET also provides transparent interaction between Mobile IP and the ad hoc routing protocol.\\nTo allow analysis of the MIPMANET proposal, we have implemented it in Network Simulator 2 (ns). The Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) Routing protocol has been used for routing within the ad hoc network. To illustrate the effects of different design choices and to form the basis of future evaluations, we have also performed some simulations. These simulations show that the ability to choose the closest gateway to the Internet is highly valuable.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93726\", \"number-of-pages\": \"89\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": \"MIPMANET; Mobile Ad Hoc Networks; Internet Access; Mobile IP; AODV\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-20T14:17:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-24T16:19:50.985+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:46:59.783+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93726\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 89.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:515356\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2003]]}, \"title\": \"Mobil Positionering med Kartst\\u00f6d\", \"language\": \"swe\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Coyet\", \"given\": \"Peter\", \"localId\": \"u1sgdwgc\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Djavaherian\", \"given\": \"Kaveh\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"SL Infrateknik AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This master thesis was conducted on behalf of SL Infrateknik AB.

The staff at Sony Ericsson has major difficulties determining where the origin of a problem is. They often simply know that something is not working. The major effort is often to detect the source of the actual problem rather than solving it.The PlayNow service provided by Sony Ericsson will be used as a reference service in this master\\u2019s thesis project.

This application acts as a proxy server and allows the browser to call methods exposed by the local Java APIs. Both the benefits and some security concerns of this approach are examined.

With advancements in embedded systems and the introduction of electric controls in the automotive industry, the design of complex electric systems for the vehicles has become one of the major design challenges. In the commercial truck industry, the development cycles are almost a decade long. Therefore, it is a big challenge to introduce a new architecture to accommodate the modern automotive technologies in the upcoming generation of trucks.Currently, the commercial truck industry relies highly on a federated electrical/electronic (E/E) architecture. In this architecture, Electronic Control Units (ECU) are responsible for computation and Input/Output operations. These ECUs are clustered into different domains based on their respective functions. However, these domains are not isolated from each other. These modules communicate with each other using a vehicular network, which is typically a controller area network in the current trucks.In the automotive industry, automation is increasing at a fast pace. As the level of automation increases, the need for high computation also increases, which increases the overall costs. This study aims to address this problem by introducing an integrated E/E architecture where all the computational power is concentrated at one place (or perhaps two or three places to allow for redundancy). This study proposes to introduce a lowcost replacement for the current ECUs with more limited computational power but with generic input/output interfaces.This thesis provides the reader with some background of the current E/E architecture of commercial trucks and introduces the reader to ECUs. Additionally, the relevant network architectures and protocols are explained. A potential solution, based upon the centralized computation based E/E architecture and its implementation are discussed followed by a detailed analysis of the replacements for ECUs. The result of this analysis, if adopted, should result in a reduction of manufacturing and design costs, as well as make the production and maintenance process easier. Moreover, this should also have environmental benefits by reducing fuel consumption.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-220183\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xv,51\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2017:199\", \"keyword\": \"ECU; E/E Architecture; CAN; LIN; Automotive Ethernet; Integrated Architecture; Commercial Trucks; Autonomous Driving; ECU; E/E Arkitektur; CAN; LIN; Automotive Ethernet; Integrerad arkitektur; Kommersiella lastbilar; Autonom k\\u00f6rningxt\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-02-07T12:49:26.149+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-12-17T15:35:36.650+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T22:52:15.544+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-220183\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 66.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1034204\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2016]]}, \"title\": \"Modernizing forms at KTH : Using Digital Signatures\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Engstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Pontus\", \"localId\": \"u1voxtcp\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Today both government agencies and companies struggle to keep up with the pace of the continuous change of technology. With all new technology there are benefits, but new problems might also occur. Implementing new technology for certain tasks may increase both efficiency and security, resulting in a more sustainable work environment. One technology that is increasingly adopted is digital signatures. Instead of using classical handwritten signatures on documents, a digital signature can be more time efficient and have higher security.In order to implement a digital signature technology some security aspects must be addressed and certain properties ensured. In the document signature process, each time an individual verifies a signature attached onto a document a log entry is created. This log contains information about who verified which document, does it have multiple parts that have been signed, does it need multiple signatures in order to be valid, and at what time and date was the document signed. Logs help to ensure the validity of the document and thereby increase the security provided by the digital signatures.At KTH, a student must sign an application form with a regular ink-written signature to start a thesis project. This process can in most cases delay the start up to two weeks. This study aims to implement digital signatures for one specific form, an application form for a thesis project. The hypothesis at the start of the project was that the use of digital signature would decrease the time of waiting significantly. Personnel at KTH using digital signature would facilitate their work efficiency, due to less printing and archiving of papers as well fewer meetings.This study will provide the reader with the necessary fundamental knowledge of cryptography and how digital signatures use this underlying technology. The methodology used in this study was to identify and modify certain software settings, as well collect data from students and personnel at KTH. The collected data was based on time measurements of digital signature processes from students and a faculty member. The results show digital signatures are faster than the current signing process with traditional ink-written signatures. Additionally, the use of digital signatures is expected to reduce the need for printing, transport, and sorting of paper documents. The resulting reduction in use of physical paper should provide environmental benefits.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-193898\", \"number-of-pages\": \"57\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2016:148\", \"keyword\": \"Authentication; cryptography; digital signature; digital certificate; X.509; Adobe Acrobat; LDAP; application form; Autentisering; kryptografi; digitala signaturer; digitala certifikat; X.509; Adobe Acrobat; LDAP; ans\\u00f6kningsblankett\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2016-11-03T08:01:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2016-10-11T14:07:07.146+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-27T05:12:51.791+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-193898\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 57.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:541098\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1995]]}, \"title\": \"Modul f\\u00f6r analog telefoni och fax\", \"language\": \"swe\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Lindell\", \"given\": \"H\\u00e5kan\", \"localId\": \"u1e8doex\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Ismailov\", \"given\": \"Yuri\", \"localId\": \"u1qe4n19\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"abstract\": null, \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-99140\", \"number-of-pages\": null, \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-07-30T14:29:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-07-13T18:30:48.206+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T03:58:35.294+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-99140\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 0.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:541089\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"Modulation Techniques and Medium Access Control Protocols for Wireless Access to ATM\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Gr\\u00fcndl\", \"given\": \"Gabriel Josef\", \"localId\": \"u1xdbh7y\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Bernhard\", \"given\": \"U.\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"ETH Z\\u00fcrich\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Meierhofer\", \"given\": \"J.\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"ETH Z\\u00fcrich\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This report covers modulation techniques and medium access control protocols for wireless ATM.Important aspects of the wave propagation, path loss and time dispersion, are discussed in conjunctionwith the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (FDM) transmission scheme.

Wireless ATM requires a considerable amount of bandwidth.The frequency reuse factor is made small by using building walls as isolation between clusters. Trafficmodels suited to model arrival processes at ATM-multiplexers are developed to use with system perfor-mance analysis in the multiuser environment. Multiplexer buffer size requirements are found to be higherwith bursty sources. ATM switching is based on multiplexing of small data units or cells.

The primary goal of the thesis is to present and analyze cloud solutions that the Swedish armed forces eventually could integrate in to their activities. The first part of the thesis gives an introduction to the cloud technology with the security aspects of a cloud as a large part of the focus. This is followed by information about the Swedish armed forces and their current IT-systems, as well as information on the requirements they have for the implementation of new IT-systems within the organization. Two different cloud services from VMware and Cloudstack have been examined in order to see whether these could be used for a future implementation. The focus of the analysis lies heavily on the security issues and questions, that arise, for each solution, as the security aspect is something that is very important for the Swedish armed forces.The thesis also touches on the economical benefits and economical difficulties associated with cloud service implementation.

The definition of a probe is somewhat vague, but generally you can say that a probe is non-intrusive, and therefore does not affect the network. It is a tool that normally listens to all messages that are transported over a network and records statistics. Almost any kind of network monitor could be called a probe. As the ex-job proceeded it became clear that there were no existing probe tool that worked for measuring IP telephony. Thus I started to look at how an IP based network is normally monitored and what you can do to guarantee QoS (Quality of Service) in an IP based network.\\nIP telephony is based on digitizing, and possibly compressing, audio information into packets of data, which are sent over the IP-based network and finally reconverted from data to audio at the receiving end. Even though the technique for IP telephony is well established, no major telephone company has implemented more than pilot tests. This is because today it is not possible to offer controlled high quality IP telephony. The standards are not yet firmly established and the tools to help operators provide high quality service either do not exist or are still being developed. Thus different vendors' products do not work together. During the time of working on this thesis, a lot has changed, new products are being introduced to the market and standards are being established. It is said that 1999 will be the year for IP telephony, the year when it will be taken seriously and really boom.\\nOne of the motives for IP telephony is reduced cost. The equipment is cheaper and it gives users the chance to bypass the ordinary telephone network, which is sometimes expensive, for example for international phone calls. Compared to normal PSTN the cost is about 40% lower, even when looking only at the comparison with circuit costs and this does not include the cost savings for the much less expensive routers instead of multiplexers and exchanges that are used in the PSTN. Another motive, and probably the most important one is the flexibility of offering new services once you are able to send different types of data over the same network. When all traffic is packetized in IP packets also makes it easier to add new services to the edge of the network. The goal is that the callers will notice no difference between IP telephony and PSTN telephony.\\nPacket networks have a long way to go to deliver high-quality voice services, but this is not the only obstacle on the way before IP telephony will be fully developed. For customers to be interested in the service, some kind of added-value has to be offered. For the telcos (telecommunication companies) IP telephony was for a long time a dilemma; if they would invest a lot of money in IP telephony and launch a high quality product, they would actually be competing with themselves. But if they did not do anything, they would risk being left behind as the new technology evolved. Strategic and tactical moves will be made every step of the way. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been invested in the circuit switched technology and the companies that have made these investments will not be anxious to retire these investments before they have shown profits. It could take anywhere from five years up to more than a decade to effect such a massive changeout. In fact, we don't know if the transition from one network to the other will ever be complete. More billions of dollars will have to be invested in packet switched equipment, and test equipment has to be developed. However, there appear to be many new operators willing to invest in this new infrastructure, so even if the existing telecommunication operators do not make this change others will offer their services.\\nExisting operators have to face the fact that IP telephone minutes generated by carriers in September 1998 totaled 35 million, based on data supplied by service providers. This sum represents a six times increase from 6.3 million minutes generated in December 1997. Expectations vary, but within approximately 5 years one third of all phone calls will be over packet switched networks. Knowing this makes it even more important to be able to offer this service with sufficient quality.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95338\", \"number-of-pages\": \"89\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-21T08:53:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-05-22T18:09:23.346+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:32:27.249+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95338\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 89.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:534359\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"More than downloading : Toward a scale with wireless connectivity\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Ahmid\", \"given\": \"Abdel\", \"localId\": \"u1hgbazx\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Sensors are light-weight, low powered devices that measure some aspect of a physical or virtual environment and transmit this information in some format.

Devices, including common household appliances, will transmit and receive data over a network. The CEO of Ericsson has stated that there will be more than 50 billion connected devices by 2020[1]. These devices could be microwaves, fridges, lights, or temperature sensors.

The sensor will be low cost and simple. It should wirelessly or via USB transmit the current weight that it measures to a receiver (specifically a gateway). This gateway will forward the message over the network to a website or mobile phone for visual presentation of the data.

These devices often include but are not limited to light switches, thermostats, thermometers, window blinds, and climate controls. The potential for these kinds of systems is huge because of the sheer number of devices that could be controlled and managed with minimal and inexpensive extra hardware. Many of the appliances in a normal home could benefit from being connected to a system that allows the owner to manage and control the devices in their home. Thus the number of potential devices is orders of magnitude larger than the number of homes connected to the system. There are several systems on the market that provide systems to monitor and control a home environment, however these systems only support specific in system devices. This uncovers a problem where a homeowner only has the opportunity to use specific products that fit into these systems. By introducing an open platform for the public that are not bound to any system we can allow more devices to be integrated in the home and contribute to further development of smarter homes.\\nThe goal with this project was to provide a scalable open platform with the possibility of asynchronous updating. This has been done by implementing multiple logical parts to both provide a web interface for the user and to allow us to handle communication and storage of data. All these parts are linked together to form a system of servers that handles all background operations. This thesis discusses and presents implementations of all of these servers, how they are implemented, communicate with each other, provide secure connections and how they can scale with increasing usage. In this process we also discuss and present techniques that were used, how to use them and their benefits, to help us reach our goal.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-97937\", \"number-of-pages\": \"41\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:084\", \"keyword\": \"Home monitoring; Smart homes; Ruby on Rails; Asynchronous message passing; Java\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-26T13:59:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-16T14:49:37.625+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:12:17.691+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-97937\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 41.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1314189\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2019]]}, \"title\": \"More tools for Canvas : Realizing a Digital Form with Dynamically Presented Questions and Alternatives\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Sarwar\", \"given\": \"Reshad\", \"localId\": \"u1zo7o3w\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879305\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Manzi\", \"given\": \"Nathan\", \"localId\": \"u1pwjpwa\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879305\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"At KTH, students who want to start their degree project must complete a paper form called \\u201cUT-EXAR: Ans\\u00f6kan om examensarbete/application for degree project\\u201d.

After the form is filled in and signed by multiple parties, a student can initiate his or her degree project. However, due to the excessively time-consuming process of completing the form, an alternative solution was proposed: a survey in the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS) that replace s the UT-EXAR form.Although the survey reduces the time required by students to provide information and find examiners, it is by no means the most efficient solution. The survey suffers from multiple flaws, such as asking students to answer unnecessary questions, and for certain questions, presenting students with more alternatives than necessary. The survey also fails to automatically organize the data collected from the students\\u2019 answers; hence administrators must manually enter the data into a spreadsheet or other record.This thesis proposes an optimized solution to the problem by introducing a dynamic survey. Moreover, this dynamic survey uses the Canvas Representational State Transfer (REST) API to access students\\u2019 program-specific data. Additionally, this survey can use data provided by students when answering the survey questions to dynamically construct questions for each individual student as well as using information from other KTH systems to dynamically construct customized alternatives for each individual student. This solution effectively prevents the survey from presenting students with questions and choices that are irrelevant to their individual case. Furthermore, the proposed solution directly inserts the data collected from the students into a Canvas Gradebook.In order to implement and test the proposed solution, a version of the Canvas LMS was created by virtualizing each Canvas-based microservice inside of a Docker container and allowing the containers to communicate over a network. Furthermore, the survey itself used the Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standard. When testing the solution, it was seen that the survey has not only successfully managed to filter the questions and alternative answers based on the user\\u2019s data, but also showed great potential to be more efficient than a survey with statically-presented data. The survey effectively automates the insertion of the data into the gradebook.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-251021\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xix,120\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2019:93\", \"keyword\": \"Canvas; Learning Management System (LMS); Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI); Docker containers; Microservices Architecture; REST API; Dynamic survey systems; Canvas; L\\u00e4rplattform; L\\u00e4rverktyg Interoperabilitet; Dockercontainenrar; Mikroservices arkitekektur; RESTful API; Dynamisk unders\\u00f6kningssystem\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2019-05-09T12:22:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2019-05-07T18:17:26.146+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T15:50:05.731+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-251021\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 139.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:456654\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2011]]}, \"title\": \"Motion Recognition : Generating real - time feedback based upon movement of a gaming controller\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Aleo Monteagudo\", \"given\": \"Francisco\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Today motion recognition has become popular for human computer interaction in areas, such as health care, computer games, and robotics. Although many research projects have investigated this field, there are still some challenges remaining, especially in real-time environments.In real-time environments, the amount of data needed to compute the user\\u2019s motion and the time required to collect and process this data are crucial parameters in the performance of a motion recognition system. Moreover, the nature of the data (accelerometer, gyroscope, camera, . . . ) determines the design of the motion recognition system. One of the most important challenges is to reduce the delay between sensing and recognizing the motion, while, at the same time, achieving acceptable levels of accuracy.In this thesis we present a solution using Nintendo\\u2019s Wii Remote that solves several problems, such as permitting multiple device interaction and synchronization. In addition, this thesis addresses the performance challenge of realizing motion recognition for such a device. Finally, this thesis introduces a Java architecture which contains a set of interfaces that can be re-used in future projects.One of the most important achievements of this project is enabling interaction among different users and devices in a real-time environment, as, our application deals with multiple devices at the same time, with an acceptable delay. The resulting application provides smooth interaction to the user. As a consequence, our application enables collaborative and competitive activities which in this thesis project were evaluated in a educational process context. In this specific context, the main goal of the researchers with whom I was collaborating was to extend traditional methods of teaching children about some abstract concepts, such as energy.In addition, this thesis shows how to achieve different levels of accuracy and performance, by implementing two different algorithms. The first one is a static algorithm based on heuristics. The second algorithm, called k-Means, is based on data clustering. The heuristics based algorithm provides a result in less than 2 milliseconds, while k-Means takes roughly 4 milliseconds to converge. A comparison of the performance and flexibility of these two algorithms is presented.This project has resulted in a multi-threaded high level architecture based on Java, which enables interaction between Wiimote devices. The Application Programming Interface, can be easily extended for future projects, via several interfaces that provide basic mechanisms, such as an event listener, message delivery, and synchronization module. Moreover, the two different motion recognition algorithms offer different performances and different flexibility features, a crucial parameter closely related with motion recognition accuracy.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-48038\", \"number-of-pages\": \"83\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2011:165\", \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-11-15T13:23:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-11-15T13:22:54.464+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T20:21:23.792+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-48038\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 83.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:507807\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2011]]}, \"title\": \"Moving the museum outside its walls : An Augmented Reality Mobile Experience\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Marshall\", \"given\": \"Tommy\", \"localId\": \"u15pxfja\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This thesis project examines how to design an Android application that uses augmented reality to help users navigate in the City of Stockholm.

Furthermore, the implementation of the Label Distribution component in a Label Edge Router of an MPLS system is described and evaluated.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95461\", \"number-of-pages\": \"34\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-15T08:39:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-05-25T14:42:13.109+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:29:25.581+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95461\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 34.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:512657\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2006]]}, \"title\": \"Multi-Cell Admission Control for WCDMA Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Azzolin de Carvalho Pires\", \"given\": \"Gustavo\", \"localId\": \"u1xj4shi\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Fodor\", \"given\": \"Gabor\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"It has long been recognized that in multi-cell WCDMA networks the admission of a new session into the system can have undesirable impact on the neighboring cells.

In this thesis, we propose a model for multi-cell multi-service WCDMA networks to study the impact of multi-cell admission and rate control algorithms on key performance measures such as the class-wise blocking and outage probabilities, block error rates, and the noise rise violation probabilities. By means of simulation we compare the performance of load based multi-cell algorithms with that of a single cell algorithm. We find that with multi-cell based algorithms the system capacity and performance (in terms of the above mentioned measures) are (in some cases significantly) better in homogeneous load scenarios as well as in the heterogeneous \\u2019hotspot\\u2019 and \\u2019hotaround\\u2019 scenarios.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92203\", \"number-of-pages\": \"66\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2006-11\", \"keyword\": \"WCDMA; Elastic Traffic; Admission Control; Rate Control; Blocking Probability; Outage Probability\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-29T08:22:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-28T15:13:37.883+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:11:18.637+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92203\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 66.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511492\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2008]]}, \"title\": \"Multimedia Messaging Service Components for Web 2.0\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Borgstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Kristofer\", \"localId\": \"u1zav6vk\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Yeung\", \"given\": \"Peter\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The purpose of this master\\u2019s thesis is to simplify the exchange (in both directions) of multimedia content between mobile phones and network attached web servers. The solution proposed in this report specifically concerns displaying Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) messages via a web browser connected to a network-attached web server and graphically authoring MMS messages via a web interface.\\nThis thesis project is important because it brings multimedia content, in the form of MMS messages, from isolation in the telecommunication world closer to wide availability via the Internet. This transition is very important as the Internet is where media is shared with the world today. This approach brings added value to end users who want to share content generated using their phone on a web site. It also provides added value to operators who want to increase the amount of MMS traffic in their networks.\\nThe solution is non-trivial because there are a number of complexities at both ends. This is because the MMS messages that are authored at mobile phones differ between both handset models and manufacturers. Moreover, the format used for MMS (MMS SMIL) is not widely used on the Internet, thus a transformation to an Internet browser supported format must be performed. The thesis examines to what extent this transformation can be completely automatic and how MMS messages can be authored through a web interface.\\nThe results show that MMS messages can be successfully transformed to HTML and embedded directly in web pages, thus providing a seamless experience for viewing MMS messages. Depending on the content of the MMS message in question, the current browser and which media player plug-ins are available, the generated HTML will be displayed differently. The results also show that MMS messages can be composed in real time* through a web interface with good results.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91878\", \"number-of-pages\": \"271\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2008-01\", \"keyword\": \"MMS; Web 2.0; components; MMS SMIL; transformation; MMS composer; MMS viewer; HTML+TIME; HTML\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T15:31:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-21T15:44:22.685+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:16:24.261+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91878\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 271.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:513179\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2005]]}, \"title\": \"Multipath Routing with Load Balancing in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Groleau\", \"given\": \"Romain\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Katabi\", \"given\": \"Dina\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"In recent years, routing research concerning wired networks has focused on minimizing the maximum utilization of the links which is equivalent to reducing the number of bottlenecks while supporting the same traffic demands. This can be achieved using multipath routing with load balancing instead of single path routing using of routing optimizers. However, in the domain of ad hoc networks multipath routing has not been investigated in depth. We would like to develop an analogy between wired and wireless networks, but before that we need to identify the major differences between these two in the case of multipath routing. First, in order to increase the network throughput, the multiple paths have to be independent so they don't share the same bottlenecks. Then, due to radio propagation properties the link capacity is not constant. So using the maximum utilization metric for wireless networks is not suitable. Based on the research done in wired networks, which has shown that using multiple paths with load balancing policies between sourcedestination pairs can minimize the maximum utilization of the links, we investigate if this is applicable to ad hoc networks.This paper proposes a multipath routing algorithm with a load balancing policy. The results obtained from an indoor 802.11g network highlight two major points. The maximum throughput is not achieved with multipath routing, but with single path routing. However, the results on the delivery ratio are encouraging, indeed we observe a real improvement thanks to our multipath routing algorithm.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92299\", \"number-of-pages\": \"65\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-IMIT-LCN.

However, the use of a single escrow agent has some drawbacks. A fraudulent request by an evil employee from the LEA can lead to improper disclosure of a session key. After the escrow agent reveals the key this evil person could fabricate data according to his/her needs and encrypt it again (using the correct session key). In this situation the persons involved in the communication session can be accused of crimes that he or she or they never committed. The problems with a single escrow agent becomes even more critical as a failure of the escrow agent can delay or even make it impossible to reveal the session key, thus the escrow agent might not be able to comply with a lawful court order or comply with their escrow agreement in the case of data being released according to this agreement (for example for disaster recovery).\\nThis thesis project focused on improving the accessibility and reliability of escrow agents, while providing good security. One such method is based on dividing the session key into M chunks and escrowing the chunks with M escrow agents. Using threshold cryptography the key can be regenerated by gathering any N-out-of-M chunks. The value of M and N may differ according to the role of the user. For a highly sophisticated session, the user might define a higher value for M and N for improved, availability, reliability, and security. For a less confidential or less important session (call), the value of M and N might be smaller.

This document describes how to overcome these obstacles by providing the necessary proxy mechanisms, leading to a transparent, seamless, and cost-effective integration of 6LoWPAN nodes into existing IPv6 network infrastructures. In particular, this document details the requirements, specification, and implementation of an embedded device responsible for such integration: a 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery Proxy- Gateway (6LP-GW).\\nMoreover, this report demonstrates that integrating 6LoWPAN nodes into existing IPv6 networks by means of a 6LP-GW as described here is both feasible and convenient in most situations. This convenience can be observed from both the network and the end-user perspectives:\\nFrom the network\\u2019s point of view, the solution proposed here integrates 6LoWPAN <b><b>into\\u00a0 </b></b>an existing IPv6 network.

It should be noted that asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) and cable- TV access networks proved to be unable to meet the requirements for small cell backhaul.This project gives a clear picture of the current broadband access network infrastructure's attributes and highlights the possibility of reducing backhaul costs by using broadband Internet connectivity as a backhaul transport option.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-129070\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiv,84\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:204\", \"keyword\": \"broadband access networks; backhaul; real-time measurements; small cell network; bredbandsteknik; returtrafik; realtidsm\\u00e4tningar; sm\\u00e5celler\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-09-30T08:58:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-09-19T10:48:19.607+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T23:16:08.572+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-129070\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 98.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:512576\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2006]]}, \"title\": \"Network Convergence or Divergence? : A service perspective on the underlying requirements of future handsets\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Possne\", \"given\": \"Jacob\", \"localId\": \"u1vou7mq\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Fontaine\", \"given\": \"Herv\\u00e9\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Sony Ericsson AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Network Convergence or Divergence, what is it, and which are the most likely developments?

A credential-based device discovery method was developed and utilized to make advantage of known credentials to access devices, which allows for more precise discovery compared to some other existing methods. The selected methods were implemented as a component of NCS to provide device discovery functionality.Another focus of this master\\u2019s thesis project was the development of an approach to network topology discovery and its representation.

This increases the eciency of the hardware, hence decreases the cost of cloud computing. However, as the load in the guest operating system increases, at some point the physical resources cannot support all the applications efficiently. Input and output services, especially network applications, must share the same total bandwidth and this sharing can be negatively affected by virtualization overheads. Network packets may undergo additional processing and have to wait until the virtual machine is scheduled by the underlying hypervisor before reaching the final service application, such as a web server.In a virtualized environment it is not the load (due to the processing of the user data) but the network overhead, that is the major problem. Modern network interface cards have enhanced network virtualization by handling IP packets more intelligently through TCP segmentation offload, interrupt coalescence, and other virtualization specific hardware.Jumbo frames have long been proposed for their advantages in traditional environment. They increase network throughput and decrease CPU utilization. \\u00a0Jumbo frames can better exploit Gigabit Ethernet and offer great enhancements to the virtualized environment by utilizing the bandwidth more effectively while lowering processor overhead.

The design is described in detail including a performance analysis of the different modules (microblocks) used. The report also provides an evaluation of the IXP2400 network processor and contrasts it to some other network processors. The detailed performance evaluation is based on a simulator of the IXP2400, which is part of Intel's Software Development Kit (SDK) version 3.0. In addition, I have investigated: the memory bus bandwidth, memory access latencies, and compared Ccompiler against hand-written microcode. These tests were based on using an application for this ET board, which I have implemented.\\nIt proved to be difficult to fit all the required functions into a single chip solution. The result is either one must wait for the next generation of this chip or one has to use a two-chip solution.

Current research suggests that the use of haptic feedback could give an increase in speed and accuracy when doing certain tasks such as outlining organ contours in medical applications or even filling in spreadsheets. This master thesis project has two different goals concerning haptic feedback. The first is to try to improve the forces for the SensAble PHANTOM Omni\\u00ae Haptic Device when used in an application to outline contours in medical images, to give the user better feedback. The PHANTOM Omni is a device able to read in user movement of an arm attached to it in three dimensions, but it is also able to output forces through this arm back to the user, i.e. giving haptic feedback. By improving these forces and thus providing better feedback, we hope that speed and accuracy increases for a user working with the mentioned application.\\nThe second part of the project consists of evaluating if delays in a network between the haptic feedback device and the place where the data sets are located impact the user perceived quality or the outcome of the task. We do this by considering a number of potential architectures for distributing the image processing and generation of haptic feedback. By considering both of these goals we hope to demonstrate both a way to get faster and more accurate results when doing the tasks already mentioned (and other tasks), but also to understand the limitations of haptic performance with regard to distributed processing. We have successfully fulfilled our first goal by introducing a haptic force which seems quite promising. This should mean that the people working with outlining contours in medical images can work more effectively; which is good both economically for hospitals and quality of service-wise for patients.\\nOur results concerning the second goal indicate that a haptic system for outlining contour can work well when using this new haptic force, even on low quality data links (which can be used for example in battlefield medicine or by specialists to conduct long distance operations or examinations) -- if the system architecture distributes the functionality so as to provide low delay haptic feedback locally.\\nWe have tried to compare our results from the second part with a model for the impact of network delay on voice traffic quality developed by Cole and Rosenbluth, but as there is not necessarily a numeric correspondence between the quality values that we used and the ITU MOS quality values for voice we cannot make a numeric comparison between our results and that model. However our experimental data seem to suggest that the decrease in perceived quality was not as fast as one might expect considering simply the ratios of the voice packet rate (typically 50 Hz) and the 1000 Hz rate of the haptic feedback loop. The decrease in quality seems to only be about one half of what the ratio of these rates might suggest (i.e., a factor of 10x faster decrease in quality with increasing delay rather than 20x).\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91494\", \"number-of-pages\": \"91\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2009:106\", \"keyword\": \"Haptics; networked haptics; haptic forces; SensAble PHANTOM Omni Device; medical imaging\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-16T14:04:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-16T11:45:02.888+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:22:36.016+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91494\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 91.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:535617\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"Networking for Smart Meters\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Dandugula\", \"given\": \"Chaitanya\", \"localId\": \"u1kefgxo\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Schoo\", \"given\": \"Peter\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Fraunhofer AISEC, Germany\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"\\\"Smart grid\\\" generally refers to a class of technology bringing electricity delivery systems into the 21st century, using computer-based remote control and automation.

Research in the European Union and the United States are currently underway to modernize the existing and aging transmission grid and to streamline the usage of electricity.\\nA typical electricity grid consists of two major entities - the utility company and the distribution control system (DCS). Electricity is generated at the utility company and the DCS is responsible for the distribution of electricity to individual homes/consumers. A smart meter (SM) is an electronic device that measures the electricity consumed at the consumer's premises and provides added information to the utility company. The data concentration unit (DCU) is a device acting as a communication hub collecting and encoding data from multiple smart meters in a neighborhood and forwarding the data to the utility company. The aim of this project is to design a network for securing the communication between the SM and the DCU in a smart metering network environment.\\nThe meter data communicated from the SM to the DCU is very sensitive and in the hands of an attacker, can reveal significant personal information about an individual. Hence it is of at most importance to protect the meter data transmitted from the SM. On the other hand the control signals transmitted from the DCU to the SM, need protection in order to thwart off unauthorized signals (i.e., an intruder can impersonate the DC and send out control signals to the SMs). Hence the SM and the DCU should be authenticated by each other and authorized and the data and/or control signals exchanged between them should be encrypted.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98210\", \"number-of-pages\": \"56\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:102\", \"keyword\": \"Smart grid; Smart Meter; DTLS; Data Concentration Unit(DCU); Security; BSI; Protection Profile\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-26T13:47:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-20T10:25:58.718+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:10:02.612+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98210\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 56.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:510608\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2009]]}, \"title\": \"Non-binary Authentication : Supplicant\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Zhang\", \"given\": \"Hengchong\", \"localId\": \"u190g8bu\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"There are a number of authentication methods for wireless local area networks.

It is independent of transport (HTTP, WSP, or OBEX) platform, operating system, and application and simplifies synchronisation of personal information between dissimilar SyncML supportive devices.\\nSyncML compliant devices are fully capable of synchronising information with a third party operated Internet based server and a desktop computer. This allows us to access, up-date and maintain information independent of Intranets or geographical position. However, synchronising and storing confidential personal information on an third party operated Internet based server entails weaknesses in our personal information security. Even if transport and storage security are used, how secure is the server where this information is stored since this server has the highest probability of being attacked. Can we really trust that an employee or other person with valid appropriated administrators access to the storage facility with the appropriate knowledge, working together with the third party server operator, won\\u2019t try to access our stored information? To prevent this, the personal information\\u2019s confidentiality must be guaranteed before the information leaves the device.\\nWhen synchronising and exchanging personal information, the information is often marked according to a specific format. The three de-facto standard PIM formats are: (1) vCard (contact information), (2) vCalendar, and (3) iCalendar (calendar and scheduling information). These formats divide the personal information into properties. Each property is assigned to contain a small piece of the personal information entry (e.g. a telephone number, an e-mail address, the time when the calendar event begins, etc.).\\nFurthermore to preserve the interoperability between different devices given by SyncML, authorised recipients must automatically be able to reverse the encryption process and decrypt the encrypted property value. Therefore general cryptographic formats are used (e.g. CMS, PGP and the newly developed XML Encryption). They add information needed by the recipients (e.g. algorithm used, padding method used on the plain text, etc.), encrypt the plaintext into cipher text, and decrypt the cipher text into plain text given the correct key.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93276\", \"number-of-pages\": \"65\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": \"3G; middleware; front-end; operator-hosted; strategy; convergence; XML; hybrid thickness client application; SyncML; Wireless OS; UMTS; GPRS; EPOC; Symbian; value added services\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-13T15:30:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-13T10:48:09.313+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:55:32.845+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93276\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 65.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:510495\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2009]]}, \"title\": \"OBSAI Interoperability in Multi-Vendor WiMAX Base Station Architecture Environment\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Saha\", \"given\": \"Sumanta\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Mikkonen\", \"given\": \"Petri\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Nokia Siemens Networks, Finland\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Wireless networks have become a necessity with the increased mobility in human life. From cellular telephony to the Internet, all types of communication are now provided over wireless networks. However, to offer wireless network coverage over an area requires a potentially expensive infrastructure deployment. Such deployment requires base stations which until now have been completely proprietary to the equipment vendors. Moreover, proprietary equipment is almost always costly and offer less flexibility than standardized modular solutions. This situation results in a high cost for network upgradation and hinders network development. A remedy is available via modularization, hence the Open Base Station Architecture Initiative (OBSAI) is trying to modularize and standardize one of the most expensive elements of the wireless infrastructure, the base station. OBSAI standards aim to modularize the base station architecture and enable true interoperability among the various modules. However, the goal has not yet been achieved due to some features of the standard. This thesis project has studied the standards and pointed out some areas that must be concentrated upon when performing interoperability tests. It also proposes several standards amendments to foster greater interoperability among the modules of a base station. This study focuses on the RP3 interface of the OBSAI specification with the goal of making truly inter-operable baseband and RF modules, thus commoditizing the modules. The result is expected to be lower cost, greater interoperability, faster time-to-market, and more cooperative research.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91500\", \"number-of-pages\": \"95\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2009:62\", \"keyword\": \"OBSAI; RP3; RP3-01; WiMAX; LTE; Base Station\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-16T14:20:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-16T12:23:54.569+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:22:27.297+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91500\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 95.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511673\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2007]]}, \"title\": \"Occupancy Sensor System : For Context-aware Computing\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"H\\u00fcbinette\", \"given\": \"Daniel\", \"localId\": \"u18uuktt\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Smith\", \"given\": \"Mark T.\", \"localId\": \"u18xiviu\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This masters thesis project, \\\"Occupancy Sensor System\\\", was conducted at Kungliga Tekniska H\\u00f6gskolan (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden, during the period 2007-04-24 \\u2013 2007-12-17. The goal of the project was to design an occupancy sensor system that determines if there exists more than one person in a defined region. The output of this system is for use in a context-aware system at the KTH Center for Wireless Systems (Wireless@KTH).\\nThe system is important because there is a need for specific input to context-aware systems concerning occupancy of spaces and because this thesis has focused on a problem that enables new complex and interesting services. Additionally, the specific problem of determining not only occupancy, but if this occupancy is zero, one, many has not been widely examined previously. The significance of zero occupants indicating an empty room has already been recognized as having economic and environmental value in terms of heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, and lighting. However, there has not been an effort to differentiate between a person being alone or if more than one person is present. A context-aware system might be able to use this later information to infer that a meeting is taking place in a meeting room, a class taking place in a classroom or that an individual is alone in a conference room, class room, etc. Thus enabling context-aware services to change their behavior based upon the differences in these situations.\\nAn occupancy sensor system prototype was designed to monitor a boundary by using a thermal detector, gumstix computer, an analog to digital converter prototype board, laptop computer, and a context broker. The testing and evaluation of the system, proved it to be sound. However, there are still further improvements and tests to be made. These improvements include: dynamic configuration of the system, communication between the different system entities, detection algorithms, and code improvements. Tests measuring accuracy of a detection algorithm and determining optimal detector placement need to be performed. The next step is to design applications that use the context information provided from the occupancy sensor system and expand the system to use multiple detectors.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91936\", \"number-of-pages\": \"128\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2007-26\", \"keyword\": \"context-aware; context information; correlation; occupancy; PUA; publish; sensor system; SER; SIP; thermal sensor; ubiquitous computing\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T14:01:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-22T16:14:59.492+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:15:36.426+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91936\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 128.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:508216\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2010]]}, \"title\": \"On-demand Television combined with non-real-time Peer-to-Peer Content Delivery for Television Content Providers\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Vodopivec\", \"given\": \"Dario\", \"localId\": \"u10x08yg\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"With the expansion of the Internet and an increasing fraction of consumers having broadband connections, more and more content is finding its way on-line. Video content is becoming one of the most popular types of media content on the Internet. Traditional media content providers, such as television networks, are placing their content on the Internet in order to gain a broader audience. On-demand websites such as kanal5play.se allow viewers to view the multimedia content they want at the time of their choice. While this gives viewers flexibility in their viewing, it creates resource problems for content providers.\\nStatistics from Kanal5 AB show that, even with individual viewers requesting content when they want, there are still patterns in which multiple viewers watch the same content at the same time. This means there are correlations in the demand for content. With unicast distribution this leads to spikes in requirements for bandwidth to the viewers. These peaks lead to high costs for network and server resources to deliver the requested content, but these resources have low average utilization. This thesis project investigates how a content provider can make use of each viewer\\u2019s own resources to deliver content to other users using peer-to-peer techniques. The thesis evaluates what methods can be used in order to reduce the content provider\\u2019s resource requirements during peak hours by exploiting copies of contents that have already been delivered to viewers who requested this same content earlier.\\nA prototype was made to evaluate the suggested design using Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI), which is built on top of the Transfer Control Protocol (TCP). Experiments show that an initial delay of several seconds is reached on a network with a simulated delay of 100ms, while a minimal initial delay was observed on a network with low delay, i.e. ideal conditions. The throughput results of the prototype show that the suggested solution is adequate for delivering on-demand content supplied by Kanal5 AB. However, the relatively poor startup performance of this solution argues for tuning the application to better work with the TCP protocol or to utilize another transport protocol - especially if the round-trip delay is large as TCP\\u2019s 3-way handshake and flow control algorithm limit the performance of the prototype system.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91100\", \"number-of-pages\": \"65\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"211\", \"keyword\": \"Peer-to-Peer; video on-demand (VoD); on-demand television; Loree\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-08T10:20:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-07T15:51:58.739+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:30:29.534+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91100\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 65.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1178505\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2018]]}, \"title\": \"On-demand virtual laboratory environments for Internetworking e-learning : A first step using docker containers\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Kokkalis\", \"given\": \"Andreas\", \"localId\": \"u168hcmp\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879305\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Learning Management Systems (LMSs) are widely used in higher education to improve the learning, teaching, and administrative tasks for both students and instructors.

This is achieved by adding an (subset) API to the ASI which enables a Content Delivery Proxy to interface with DCXP and leverage context information to enable opportunistic content delivery across Ambient Networks.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92031\", \"number-of-pages\": \"83\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2007-23\", \"keyword\": \"Ambient Networks; Context Dissemination; Context-Awareness; Content Delivery\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-26T10:50:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T17:41:55.228+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:14:01.940+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92031\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 83.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:541075\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2003]]}, \"title\": \"Optimisation of End-to-End TCP Performance in A UMTS Network\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Glifberg\", \"given\": \"Fredrik\", \"localId\": \"u19og8mq\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Helge\", \"given\": \"Johan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Netcom Consultants\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Due to the FEC and ARQ mechanisms in UMTS the wireless part will not introduce loss, but instead introduces latency.

Making sure that this information is easily accessible to its employees is not an easy task. For this task Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems come in handy. However, the ERP systems contain lots of information and may be too complex to handle this information or may be too slow in sharing this information within the organisation. This thesis introduces a new solution for how mobile applications can connect to an ERP system by exploiting database synchronisation, which allows the employees to get the information wherever they are without the need to directly access the ERP system.There are three important questions in this thesis: how the ERP works, how to build a mobile application and, how to build a back end? By combining answers to these questions a whole system is built which is production ready and can copy data between the ERP system and the back end and show the information in a mobile application. The overarching goals were to build a system that could extract data from the ERP system into a proprietary back end and a mobile application that could synchronise with the back end. However, synchronisation between the mobile application and the back end was not implemented due to lack of time. The back end had to be able to scale up to 500 concurrent users and respond within 3 seconds, both of these goals were achieved. The mobile application that was built to display the information to the end user was built with usability in mind, since Netlight wanted a straightforward application that anyone could use. The mobile application was shown to have good usability.The results of this thesis project show that building systems around ERPs, instead of inside them, gives these systems the ability to scale, improved the implementation time, and reduced the company\\u2019s maintenance efforts.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-122986\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xvi,118\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:89\", \"keyword\": \"Enterprise Resource Planning systems; Mobile application development; systems integration; information extraction; Aff\\u00e4rssystem; mobil applikationsutveckling; systemintegration; extrahering av information\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-05-30T15:50:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-05-30T15:37:02.356+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T00:17:20.225+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-122986\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 134.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:621611\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2013]]}, \"title\": \"Optimizing System Level Testing of Evolved Packet Gateway\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Wang\", \"given\": \"Guojun\", \"localId\": \"u1yhko8k\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Nordling\", \"given\": \"Karin\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson AB, Sweden\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The goal of this thesis project is to improve industrial system testing efficiency.

Mobile development is a brand new field and becoming more and more popular. The design process and source code can be used as reference for mobile developers. Based on the Terraplay Test Toolkit, a series of experiments were conducted to test the ability of TTK. These experiments focused on end-to-end latency effects of wireless multiplayer games under different situations such as different packet size, different sending rates, high speed movement, and so on. Although TTK is not a professional test tool, it still reflects the latency variance under different conditions correctly. From these experiments, it was found that for the Terraplay enabled wireless multiplayer games, large average packet size (300 bytes) is NOT a factor with regard to the latency on the Terraplay System; the packet rate can affect the game latency. In a high speed-moving environment, game latency doesn\\u2019t obvious increase. Using HTTP can cause three times higher latency than simply using TCP.

This is exemplified in Software Defined Radios (SDRs) systems. A SDR is a radio system whose components are realized in software rather than in hardware. Among the main advantages of such systems, the most important are flexibility and portability. A SDR system is flexible since its components can be modified and reconfigured without physically modifying the system. Furthermore, a SDR system can be ported to a number of different environments, hence it is not tied to a specific hardware platform. Due to these characteristics, SDRs are being used more and more in both military and public safety sectors.\\nA straightforward consequence of the adaptability to variable environments is the porting of SDRs to embedded processors and handheld devices. These devices usually have significant limitations both in terms of computational performance and power constraints. Although the trend in the development of General Purpose Processors (GPPs) and Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) dictated by the Moore\\u2019s Law has increased the performance of embedded devices, currently they face limitations due to both the power consumption and to the execution time when executing even partial SDR systems.\\nThe objective of this thesis project is the evaluation and the optimization of the performance of software running on the OMAP3530 platform on a BeagleBoard. This thesis focuses specifically on the system performances as a function of the configuration of the communication link between the GPP and the DSP in order to reduce as much as possible the system delay due to the communication among the processor cores in the system. Furthermore, this thesis compares the performance achieved by the system by exploiting the DSP and the NEON vector coprocessor. The results of this study show reduced communication delays, thus facilitating the porting of a SDR like system to an OMAP platform. The experiments were performed on a BeagleBoard Revision C3, a hardware platform based on the Texas Instruments OMAP3530. The OMAP3530 is a processor made up of two cores: the GPP, a 600-MHz ARM Cortex\\u2122-A8 Core and an advanced Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) microprocessor Core, specifically the TMS320C64x+\\u2122 DSP Core. The communication between the two cores is via the DSP/BIOS Link, software designed by Texas Instruments to facilitate the exchanging of data between the two cores. The optimal DSPLink setup was obtained with the MSGQ module. This offered good performance, while reducing the system power consumption and reducing the load on the GPP. Moreover, the DSP-based solution offered better performance than the NEON-based configuration.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-31067\", \"number-of-pages\": \"145\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"21\", \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-03-08T10:07:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-03-08T10:07:16.547+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-25T00:04:33.006+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-31067\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 145.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:542230\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"Performance evaluation of security mechanisms in Cloud Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Kannan\", \"given\": \"Anand\", \"localId\": \"u101tjf9\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Fusenig\", \"given\": \"Volker\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Fraunhofer AISEC, Munich, Germany\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Sharma\", \"given\": \"Ayush\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Fraunhofer AISEC, Munich, Germany\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud service provisioning model which largely focuses on data centre provisioning of computing and storage facilities. The networking aspects of IaaS beyond the data centre are a limiting factor preventing communication services that are sensitive to network characteristics from adopting this approach. Cloud networking is a new technology which integrates network provisioning with the existing cloud service provisioning models thereby completing the cloud computing picture by addressing the networking aspects. In cloud networking, shared network resources are virtualized, and provisioned to customers and end-users on-demand in an elastic fashion. This technology allows various kinds of optimization, e.g., reducing latency and network load. Further, this allows service providers to provision network performance guarantees as a part of their service offering. However, this new approach introduces new security challenges. Many of these security challenges are addressed in the CloNe security architecture.This thesis presents a set of potential techniques for securing different resource in a cloud network environment which are not addressed in the existing CloNe security architecture. The thesis begins with a holistic view of the Cloud networking, as described in the Scalable and Adaptive Internet Solutions (SAIL) project, along with its proposed architecture and security goals. This is followed by an overview of the problems that need to be solved and some of the different methods that can be applied to solve parts of the overall problem, specifically a comprehensive, tightly integrated, and multi-level security architecture, a key management algorithm to support the access control mechanism, and an intrusion detection mechanism. For each method or set of methods, the respective state of the art is presented. Additionally, experiments to understand the performance of these mechanisms are evaluated on a simple cloud network test bed.The proposed key management scheme uses a hierarchical key management approach that provides fast and secure key update when member join and member leave operations are carried out. Experiments show that the proposed key management scheme enhances the security and increases the availability and integrity.A newly proposed genetic algorithm based feature selection technique has been employed for effective feature selection. Fuzzy SVM has been used on the data set for effective classification. Experiments have shown that the proposed genetic based feature selection algorithm reduces the number of features and hence decreases the classification time, while improving detection accuracy of the fuzzy SVM classifier by minimizing the conflicting rules that may confuse the classifier. The main advantages of this intrusion detection system are the reduction in false positives and increased security.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-99464\", \"number-of-pages\": \"85\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:174\", \"keyword\": \"Cloud Networks; Key management; mobile agent; telco cloud; open flow; Intrusion Detection System (IDS); Genetic Algorithm (GA); Fuzzy Support Vector Machine (FSVM); tenfold cross validation\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-07-31T08:53:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-07-30T14:58:01.253+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T03:51:20.765+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-99464\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 85.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1159529\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2017]]}, \"title\": \"Performance Optimization of Virtualized Packet Processing Function for 5G RAN\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"\\u00d6stermark\", \"given\": \"Filip\", \"localId\": \"u1me8myg\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"F\\u00e9nyes\", \"given\": \"G\\u00e1bor\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The advent of the fifth generation mobile networks (5G) presents many new challenges to satisfy the requirements of the upcoming standards. The 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) has several functions which must be highly optimized to keep up with increasing performance requirements. One such function is the Packet Processing Function (PPF) which must process network packets with high throughput and low latency. A major factor in the pursuit of higher throughput and lower latency is adaptability of 5G technology. For this reason, Ericsson has developed a prototype 5G RAN PPF as a Virtualized Network Function (VNF) using an extended version of the Data Plane Development Kit\\u2019s Eventdev framework, which can be run on a general purpose computer. This thesis project optimizes the throughput and latency of a 5G RAN PPF prototype using a set of benchmarking and code profiling tools to find bottlenecks within the packet processing path, and then mitigates the effects of these bottlenecks by changing the configuration of the PPF.Experiments were performed using IxNetwork to generate 2 flows with GTP-u/UDP/IPv4 packets for the PPF to process. IxNetwork was also used to measure throughput and latency of the PPF.The results show that the maximum throughput of the PPF prototype could be increased by 40.52% with an average cut-through latency of 97.59% compared to the default configuration in the evaluated test case, by reassigning the CPU cores, performing the packet processing work in fewer pipeline stages, and patching the RSS function of the packet reception (Rx) driver.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-218090\", \"number-of-pages\": \"vii,69\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT\", \"collection-number\": \"2017:198\", \"keyword\": \"5G; RAN; virtualization; packet processing; NFV; optimization; 5G; RAN; virtualisering; packet processing; NFV; optimering\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-02-09T11:18:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-11-22T18:31:06.840+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T23:17:18.612+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-218090\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 76.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:510986\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2008]]}, \"title\": \"Personalized TV with Recommendations : Integrating Social Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Shahan\", \"given\": \"Michel\", \"localId\": \"u1wbagus\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Lidstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Mattias\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This master\\u2019s thesis concerns how to recommend multimedia content which a user might view \\u2013 with some media player.

The thesis investigates, models, and designs an architecture for a policy management system based on OASIS XACML, that creates an extension to the architecture for management of context information in the AN. In addition to a policy management architecture within an AN, a policy management architecture for composing ANs is also created. To facilitate the transfer of requests and policies, the thesis creates a Policy Management Protocol.

One of the more recent updates, Bluetooth 5.1, provides the ability to compute the location using Angle of Arrival (AoA) or Angle of Departure (AoD). These new features have allowed for better positioning accuracies, where AoA-based positioning has shown sub-meter accuracy. An application area for BLE-based IPS is retail stores where the technology can benefit both the store and its customers.

Additionally, we assume that the application can use the device's e-compass or other means to determine in which direction the user's device is oriented.Based on the position and orientation of the user, the software is assumed to access a database to know what item(s) are near the customer.

This Master of Science thesis investigates how a small start-up company operating in the mobile Internet field could be able to let its customers pay for the companies services.\\nDifferent payment possibilities have been described, compared and evaluated. Amongst the possible solutions are direct Internet payment, credit cards, and micro payment systems. The evaluated solutions are mainly focused on enabling Internet based payments to take place, but the goal is to be able to conduct payments using a standard mobile device. Several technologies could be used to extend the Internet solution to the mobile market. Techniques that can be used and are evaluated in this thesis are: CTI, SMS, WAP, and SAT.\\nWhen offering payment possibilities on the Internet an obvious problem is the security matters. Nevertheless this thesis describes and evaluates the possible solutions available today and a large factor when extending the Internet based payment method to the mobile area are the user confidence and easy to use factors. Furthermore the chosen solution should be possible for a small company to implement. That means that no hardware implementations in the mobile device are acceptable.\\nTwo possible solutions have been implemented and are described in the report. First a real credit card solution for the web case. Second the web solution has been extended to work in a wireless GSM environment using SMS.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93532\", \"number-of-pages\": \"152\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-18T08:34:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-20T10:59:27.909+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:50:33.449+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93532\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 152.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511440\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2008]]}, \"title\": \"Position Determination using multiple wireless interfaces\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Hassell\\u00f6f\", \"given\": \"Daniel\", \"localId\": \"u198k88u\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Bataille\", \"given\": \"F.\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Alcatel Research\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This Master\\u2019s thesis studies different ways of exploiting the signal strength measurements from wireless interfaces for position determination.

However, extracting text from images into a digital format is not an easy problem to solve, and the outputs from the OCR frameworks often include errors. The complexity comes from the many variations in (digital) fonts, handwriting, lighting, etc. To tackle this problem, this thesis investigates two different methods for correcting the errors in OCR output. The used dataset consists of Swedish addresses. The methods are therefore applied to postal automation to investigate the usage of these methods for further automating postal work by automatically reading addresses on parcels using OCR. The main method, the lexical implementation, uses a dataset of Swedish addresses so that any valid address should be in this dataset (hence there is a known and limited vocabulary), and misspelled addresses are corrected to the address in the lexicon with the smallest Levenshtein distance. The second approach is to use the same dataset, but with artificial errors, or artificial noise, added. The addresses with this artificial noise are then used together with their correct spelling to train a machine learning model based on Neural machine translation (Neural Machine Translation (NMT)) to automatically correct errors in OCR read addresses. The results from this study could contribute by defining in what direction future work connected to OCR and postal addresses should go. The results were that the lexical implementation outperformed the NMT model. However, more experiments including real data would be required to draw definitive conclusions as to how the methods would work in real-life applications.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-313940\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,79\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": \"OCR; OCR post-processing; OCR post-correction; NMT; Lexical model; OCR; efterbehandling f\\u00f6r OCR; post-korrigering f\\u00f6r OCR; NMT; lexikal modell\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-15T07:34:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-13T14:45:52.302+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-08-04T12:16:11.498+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-313940\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": \"Stockholm\", \"publisher\": \"KTH Royal Institute of Technology\", \"total_pages\": 92.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:531955\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1997]]}, \"title\": \"Presentation of News Telegrams on the World Wide Web\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"J\\u00f6nson\", \"given\": \"Tobias\", \"localId\": \"u1p9xdee\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}, {\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Hjelm\", \"given\": \"Johan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Bonnier Affarirsinformation\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This thesis describes how to transmit and present news telegrams on the World Wide Web using message queues.

Hardware and software have been used to generate the NMEA messages and to generate a precise 1 pulse per second signal. A graphical user interface (GUI) has been created in order to allow the operators of the emulator to input various parameters to the system used to emulate a GPS receiver.Using this emulator avoids the need for expensive GPS receivers and their connection to an antenna with a good view of the GPS satellites. More importantly, this GPS receiver emulator makes it easier to set up a lab environment for testing different situations with regard to signaling with NMEA data between the emulated GPS receiver and the radio base station equipment that is under test. For example, this allows tests involving incorrect NEMA messages or <b>non</b> once per second pulses.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-118070\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii, 69\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:1\", \"keyword\": \"GPS receiver; NMEA data; 1 pulse per second; Radio Base Station; GPS mottagare; NMEA datan; 1 pulse per skund; Radiobassstationer\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-02-11T12:54:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-02-11T11:25:21.623+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T01:14:58.607+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-118070\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 82.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:541137\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1995]]}, \"title\": \"Provision of reliable multicast services in ATM networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Skoglund\", \"given\": \"Per\", \"localId\": \"u144fhxh\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Lindgren\", \"given\": \"Per\", \"localId\": \"u1lz6cg7\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"abstract\": null, \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-99146\", \"number-of-pages\": null, \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-07-30T14:17:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-07-14T14:40:39.084+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T03:58:23.691+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-99146\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 0.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:515556\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2001]]}, \"title\": \"Push services based on SIP\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Dominique\", \"given\": \"Torkel\", \"localId\": \"u1enov0e\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Bj\\u00f6rkner\", \"given\": \"J\\u00f6rgen\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"HotSIP\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is the most potential protocol for Real Time IP communication, for example IP telephony, today.

Moreover, most of this software and tools are standalone applications, thus they are unconnected and their data can be inconsistent and duplicated. This increase both heterogeneity and the complexity of the development environment.To address this situation, tool integration solutions based on Linked Data are used, as they provide scalable and sustainable integration across different engineering tools. Different systems can access and share data by following the Linked-Data-based Open Service for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) specification. OSLC uses the Tracked Resource Set (TRS) protocol to enable a server to expose a resource set and to enable a client to discover a resource in the resource set.Currently, the TRS protocol uses a client pull for the client to update its data and to synchronize with the server. However, this method is inefficient and time consuming. Moreover, high-frequency pulling may introduce an extra burden on the network and server, while low-frequency pulling increases the system\\u2019s latency (as seen by the client).A push-based low-latency solution for the TRS protocol was implemented using Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) technology. The TRS server uses MQTT to push the update patch (called a ChangeEvent) to the TRS client, then the client updates its content according to this ChangeEvent. As a result, the TRS client synchronizes with the TRS server in real time.Furthermore, a TRS adaptor was developed for Atlassian\\u2019s JIRA, a widely-used project and issue management tool. This JIRA-TRS adaptor provides a TRS provider with the ability to share data via JIRA with other software or tools which utilize the TRS protocol.In addition, a simulator was developed to simulate the operations in JIRA for a period of time (specifically the create, modify, and delete actions regarding issues) and acts as a validator to check if the data in TRS client matches the data in JIRA.An evaluation of the push-based TRS system shows an average synchronization delay of around 30 milliseconds. This is a huge change compared with original TRS system that synchronized every 60 seconds.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-213126\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiii,48\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2017:138\", \"keyword\": \"Linked Data; Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration; Tracked Resource Set; JIRA; Message Queue Telemetry Transport; Push Technology; L\\u00e4nkade Data; Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration; Tracked Resource Set; JIRA; Message Queue Telemetry Transport; Push-teknologi\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-10-13T09:14:10.973+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-08-29T09:48:27.600+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-27T00:30:01.911+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-213126\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 61.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:531909\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1997]]}, \"title\": \"QoS over Winsock 2 via ATM\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Kasujja\", \"given\": \"David\", \"localId\": \"u17u8fm6\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Abrahamsson\", \"given\": \"Leif\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ellemtel Utveckling AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The aim of the masters thesis was to investigate the properties of Winsock 2, demonstrate an application requesting QoS via Winsock 2 over ATM and analyze it from a user perspective. An application requesting QoS via Winsock 2 over ATM has been demonstrated. Analyzing QoS from a user perspective is a difficult task, especially translating it into technical specifications. A useful method used for analyzing QoS from a user perspective is Round Trip Time (RTT) measurements between two end statations (PC's) communicating over an ATM link. This has been carried out with other programs running parallel to the test program (measuring the RTT) to study the effects that these programs may have on the RTT and eventually the end users perspective of QoS. Other tests performed include studying CPU utilization as a function of the receiving data rate. One application transmitts at different data rates to another application on another end station (PC) over the ATM link and the CPU utilization on the receiving end station is studied.\\nTo run real time applications (voice, video, etc) and maintain good quality with minimal delay over an ATM link, these programs should be given high priority by the Operating System or other mechanism to minimize delay. Disk I/O should also be kept minimal, as this could affect the delay or overall quality of the delay sensitive programs. A draw back that many application programmers will experience whilst writing programs for ATM, is the number of QoS parameters that have to be set.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-96662\", \"number-of-pages\": null, \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-13T11:06:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-08T12:07:07.631+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:17:08.964+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-96662\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 0.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:541080\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2001]]}, \"title\": \"QoS Simulation of IP based GSM and EDGE Radio Access Network\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Kristiansen\", \"given\": \"Joakim\", \"localId\": \"u16w4lbs\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Due to increased popularity and acceptance of mobile communication the data services (i.e., General Packet Radio Services) has become standardized and is now implemented and ready for usage. General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) enables a mobile user to use up to eight time slots in a channel to increase their bitrate during data transmission. Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) will increase the bitrate during data transmission even more due to a newer modulation techniques which can be used in a given time slot.Both voice calls and data traffic generates signalling to setup and release the sessions for voice calls and data traffic. In an IP based GSM and EDGE Radio Access Network (IP based GERAN) there will be problems to ensure low delay of packets between nodes for voice traffic and signalling traffic. There are different ways to cope with this problem mainly using different scheduling algorithms, like Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) and Class Based Queuing (CBQ).IP based GERAN using Class Based Queuing was studied using simulation. The first case study different bandwidths for voice traffic and control signalling were examined. In the second case study the voice traffic has higher priority than signalling traffic and in the third case study the voice traffic and control signalling have the same priority. The result is that in the first case the control signalling is affected, but not delayed due to the amount of voice traffic. In the second case the control signalling is affected when voice traffic used more than 60% of the bandwidth and in the third case the control signalling is not affected at all.If some of the new protocols (e.g., SIP) are used to carry a voice over IP session from a mobile terminal to a terminal in the Internet it would be desirable to be able to ensure Quality of Service end to end.

In other words, there should not be any decrease in the quality of service experienced by the end users due to the mobility or wireless factor.\\nWhen developing quality of service support mechanisms that use characteristics specific to the Internet Protocol, considerations have to be made to make certain that the solutions and implementations developed will be deployable with the next generation Internet Protocol, IPv6. Since the ever decreasing address space in IPv4 is becoming more and more of a problem, at some point migration to IPv6 has to be made. Therefore, this thesis will base its developments on the use of IPv6.\\nThe thesis concerns the problem of providing statistical QoS guarantees for multimedia applications running over a wireless LAN such as WaveLAN. Using the DiffServ model and support of IPv6, we develop mechanisms for managing QoS and mobility. With the use of pre-connection schemes and a domain routing approach, Mobile Node mobility and Handoffs are handled in such a way to diminish latencies that occur when in-LAN and cross-LAN handoffs are made. To handle QoS guarantees, a bandwidth broker placed in the Access Points manages bandwidth allocations for different cells and configures the traffic parameters of each mobile so that the usage of the wireless MAC layer is controlled.

This was developed together with the app developer company The Mobile Life, who also provided access to app data for 16 of their published iOS and Android apps. The implementation utilizes automated download and import from online data sources, and provides a web based graphical user interface to display this data using tables and charts.Using mathematical software, a number of statistical methods have been applied to the collected dataset. Analysis findings include different categories (clusters) of apps, the existence of correlations between metrics such as an app\\u2019s market ranking and the number of downloads, a long-tailed distribution of keywords used in app reviews, regression analysis models for the distribution of downloads, and an experimental application of Pareto\\u2019s 80-20 rule which was found relevant to the gathered dataset.Recommendations to the app company include embedding session tracking libraries such as Google Analytics into future apps.

The users can dial-up over public switched telephone network connection when they want to access the Internet or a Corporate LAN. The construction of new telephony networks based on IP-technology gives the possibility to integrate new services in these networks. Such a new service could be a remote access service integrated in the Media Gateways used for IP-telephony. The main goal with this Master Thesis project is to evaluate possible architectures for integrating distributed remote access service in Voice over IP networks.\\nThe conclusion of my evaluation is that the best way to integrate the dial-up network access service in VoIP networks is the L2TP solution. Traditionally a PPP session is established between the dial-up user and the network access server over a PSTN/ISDN connection. In the L2TP solution a Media Gateway terminates the physical and data link layer and use the L2TP protocol to tunnel the PPP session to a network access server over the IP network. The PPP session is terminated on the network access server.\\nAnother interesting solution is the PPP solution where the Media Gateway and a router handle all the dial-up network access features that a traditional network access server normally provides. The PPP session is terminated directly on the Media Gateway and the traffic is forwarded out on the external network by the router. In this solution the network access server is no longer needed.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-94950\", \"number-of-pages\": \"61\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-20T16:15:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-05-11T16:37:57.568+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:36:59.749+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-94950\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 61.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:528442\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1998]]}, \"title\": \"Real-time Multimedia Transmission over a Dynamic Synchronous Transfer Mode Network\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Larsson\", \"given\": \"Jonas\", \"localId\": \"u1vqbc68\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Torstendahl\", \"given\": \"Seved\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Netinsight\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"In this thesis we design and implement a system to transport multimedia traffic (e.g., video and audio) over a Dynamic synchronous Transfer Mode (DTM) network.

Much research is thus focused on how to increase the transmission rate in cellular networks. A general consequence of increasing transmission rate in a radio link is a corresponding increase in transmit power, resulting in increased interference and reduced network capacity. The straightforward way to reduce this effect is to shorten the link distance, which in the cellular case means shrinking the cells. This, however, means increased control traffic for handoffs and location registration, as well as increased infrastructure costs.An alternative approach, which has received increased attention lately, is the introduction of wireless multihop access networks to relay traffic between the wired infrastructure and the users. Such an access network must clearly accommodate all types of services expected to operate in next generation systems, including real-time services. However, wireless multihop networks have traditionally had problems meeting the delay requirements posed by such services.In this thesis, we will study the delay performance through analysis and simulation of such a network, based on the Virtual Cellular Network proposal [1], in which geographically fixed wireless relays are deployed to act as both network nodes and user relays.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92264\", \"number-of-pages\": \"57\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-IMIT-LCN.

This thesis is conducted for the Institute for Microelectronics and Information Technology (IMIT) at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm (Sweden) and for the Department of Telecommunications at Politecnico di Torino in Turin (Italy).\\nThis thesis addresses an area with significant potential for offering services to mobile users. In such a scenario users should have minimal interaction with applications which, by taking into account available context information, should be able to make decisions, such as setting up delivery paths between peers without requiring a third party for the negotiation.\\nIn wireless reconfigurable networks, the mobile users are on the move and must deal with dynamic changes of network resources. In such a network, mobile users should be able to contact other peers or resources by using the current route. Thus although manual configuration of the network is a possible solution, it is not easily used because of the dynamic properties of the system which would demand too much user interaction. However, existing discovery protocols fall short of accomodating the complexity of reconfigurable and heterogeneous networks.\\nThe primary objective of this thesis work was to investigate a new approach at the application level for signaling by taking advantage of SIP\\u2019s features. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is used to provide naming and localization of the user, and to provide functionality to invite users to establish sessions and to agree on communication parameters. The Specific Event Notification of the SIP protocol provides a framework for the notification of specific events and I believed that it could be instantiated as solution to the problem for reconfigurable application networks.\\nThis thesis proposes a method for providing localization information to SIP User Agents in order to establish sessions for service discovery. Furthermore, this method should consider context meta-data to design strategies effective in heterogeneous networks. A viable solution must support (re)location of users at the application layer when they roam between different wireless networks, such as GPRS and WLAN. An analysis of the implications of the proposed model is presented; in this analysis emphasis has been placed on how this model interacts with existing services.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93115\", \"number-of-pages\": \"116\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": \"wireless reconfigurable networks; Session Initiation Protocol (SIP); context meta-data; service discovery\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-13T14:50:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-11T17:09:11.759+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:58:05.735+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93115\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 116.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:510979\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2008]]}, \"title\": \"Remote Desktop : Integrating multiple devices\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Sabat\\u00e9 Mogica\", \"given\": \"David\", \"localId\": \"u1op7l5a\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": null, \"abstract\": \"Electronic devices have acquired an increasingly important role in our society and are integrated in our lives making both the users and their devices more accessible. Currently in the western world most families have at least one computer. This computer is generally equipped with multimedia accessories and an Internet connection. Portable devices, such as mobile phones and PDAs, are part of this technological and social environment. One might think about using a hands free Bluetooth headset together with a mobile phone, to obtain better sound quality, using a keyboard such as the Handykey Corp. Twiddler in order to dial/type quicker or send SMS messages in an easier way, watching a video on a large computer screen that had previously been downloaded to your mobile phone, etcetera. However, there is a problem when it comes to the interconnectivity between all these devices.\\nToday users face many difficulties when attempting to use what should be the aggregated possibilities of their devices, rather than simply the functionality of each device. The hypothesis of this project is that the user's difficulties could be overcome if their devices could be internetworked.\\nFor example, even though mobile phones and PDAs often have a USB interface, unlike typical desktop or laptop computers these devices have been designed to only be USB slaves -- hence other USB devices cannot be directly attached to them. There are some signs of this changing with the introduction of USB On-The-Go - but we believe that this is a short-sighted evolutionary step.\\nThe obvious solution is to internetwork these devices. For example, by attaching these various USB devices to a computer that is a USB bus master (host) - we can enable the user to use their USB Twiddler with a USB phone. In this way, a user could remotely access the functions of the set of all of their portable devices - without worrying about how to directly interconnect them in pairs. This could enable new functionality, such as the user being able to answer an incoming call to their cellular phone with the keypad of the Twiddler, while using the audio input and output functions of their Bluetooth headset.\\nWe begin by examining a number of means to establish and use remote connections to access systems remotely. We have focused on the most popular desktop sharing systems, specifically those that use remote desktop protocols. Initially we require manual configuration or use of a discovery protocol to identify the different devices. Later we will examine additional protocols, along with some potentially automatic configuration mechanisms.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91667\", \"number-of-pages\": \"36\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2008-15\", \"keyword\": \"vnc; remote desktop; X Windowing system\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T15:46:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-19T15:52:46.062+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:19:57.743+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91667\", \"note\": \"1F1421 Project report Oral presentation given 2008-07-30 14:00 http://www.ict.kth.se/info/GRU/Events/Old-Seminars/2008/20080730-14.00-CCS-Exjobb-presentation.html\", \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": \"KTH Royal Institute of Technology\", \"total_pages\": 36.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:514611\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2004]]}, \"title\": \"Remote Residential Control System\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Lang\", \"given\": \"Ming-Shuang\", \"localId\": \"u1qjqeer\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Walling\", \"given\": \"Erik\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"SiceIT AB\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Thelin\", \"given\": \"Bj\\u00f6rn\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ecton AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"A remote residential control system enables home users to remotely manage devices at their homes.

A whistleblowing service within an entity should provide secure communication for the organization and its employees. One way to make whistleblowing more accessible is by providing a service for verbal reporting, for example by recording and sending voice messages. However, ensuring that the speaker is secure and can feel anonymous can be difficult since speech varies between individuals - different accents, pitch, or the speed of the voice are examples of factors that a speaker can be identified by.Common ways of voice anonymization, that you hear on the news for example, can often be backtracked or in other ways be deanonymized such that the speaker\\u2019s identity is revealed, especially for people who know the speaker. Today we have many developing technologies, such as machine learning, which could be used to greatly improve anonymity or deanonymization. However, greater anonymity is often costly with regard to the intelligibility and sometimes the naturalness of the voice content. Therefore, we studied and evaluated a number of anonymization methods with respect to anonymity, intelligibility, and overall user-friendliness. The aim of this was to map what anonymization methods are suitable for whistleblowing and implement proof of concepts of such an anonymizer. The results show differences between anonymization methods and that some perform better than others, but in different ways. Different methods should be selected depending on the perceived threat.

It involves PacketLogic traffic data collecting, MySQL database storing, and traffic and user behavior analysis by using Python scripts.\\n\\u00a0\\nOur approach provides new insights on residential network traffic properties and Internet user habits of households, covering topics of aggregated traffic pattern, household traffic modeling, traffic and user penetration for applications, grouping analysis by cluster and subscriber, and concurrent application analysis. The analysis solutions we provide are based on open source tools without proprietary, giving the most flexibility for codes modification and distribution.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-27001\", \"number-of-pages\": \"62\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2010-12-02T13:42:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2010-12-02T13:40:43.282+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-25T01:14:00.370+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-27001\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 62.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:634366\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2013]]}, \"title\": \"Resource monitoring in a Network Embedded Cloud : An extension to OSPF-TE\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Roozbeh\", \"given\": \"Amir\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0003-4088-7884\", \"localId\": \"u15ez6rj\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Sefidcon\", \"given\": \"Azimeh\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The notions of \\\"network embedded cloud\\\", also known as a \\\"network enabled cloud\\\" or a \\\"carrier cloud\\\", is an emerging technology trend aiming to integrate network services while exploiting the on-demand nature of the cloud paradigm. A network embedded cloud is a distributed cloud environment where data centers are distributed at the edge of the operator's network. Distributing data centers or computing resources across the network introduces topological and geographical locality dependency.In the case of a network enabled cloud, in addition to the information regarding available processing, memory, and storage capacity, resource management requires information regarding the network's topology and available bandwidth on the links connecting the different nodes of the distributed cloud. This thesis project designed, implemented, and evaluated the use of open shortest path first with traffic engineering (OSPF-TE) for propagating the resource status in a network enabled cloud. The information carried over OSPF-TE are used for network-aware scheduling of virtual machines. In particular, OSPF-TE was extended to convey virtualization and processing related information to all the nodes in the network enabled cloud.Modeling, emulation, and analysis shows the proposed solution can provide the required data to a cloud management system by sending a data center's resources information in the form of new opaque link-state advertisement with a minimum interval of 5 seconds. In this case, each embedded data centers injects a maximum 38.4 bytes per second of additional traffic in to the network.&lt;p&gt;\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-124367\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xxxix,338\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:85\", \"keyword\": \"network enabled cloud; network embedded cloud; carrier cloud; Cloud LSA; data center model; opaque LSA; link-state update policy; OSPF-TE; resource monitoring; network-aware; cloud management system; extended TED; n\\u00e4tverk aktiverat moln; n\\u00e4tverk inb\\u00e4ddade moln; b\\u00e4rare moln; moln LSA; datacenter modell; ogenomskinlig LSA; l\\u00e4nk-stat uppdatering policy; OSPF-TE; resurs \\u00f6vervakning; cloud f\\u00f6rvaltning systemet; f\\u00f6rl\\u00e4ngd TED\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-07-01T08:57:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-06-30T12:46:24.500+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T23:55:51.148+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-124367\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 377.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:631732\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2013]]}, \"title\": \"Route aggregation in Software-defined Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Shahzad\", \"given\": \"Syed Amir\", \"localId\": \"u1p20ukx\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Sk\\u00f6ldstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Pontus\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Acreo AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Software-defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging trend in communication networks that facilitates decoupling the control and data plane of multilayer switches. A logically centralized controller hosted on a server configures the forwarding tables (flow tables) of switches in order to route the various data flows.\\u00a0 To implement SDN, OpenFlow technology has been adopted by packet switching vendors as it provides increased flexibility for the control and management of a packet switched domain. OpenFlow technology provides flow based switching that is controlled by a network management control application running in an OpenFlow controller. In this thesis work we investigate how an OpenFlow Controller communicates with a legacy network via the OSPF routing protocol, how the size of the OpenFlow network effects the resources (memory and CPU) of a legacy router to whom the controller communicates. Also we examine bandwidth utilization of the link (between the OpenFlow network and legacy router). The main goal of this thesis is to find methods to reduce the consumption of resources of a legacy router. This study shows that the size of OpenFlow network directly affects the usage of the link\\u2019s bandwidth, and the memory and CPU usage of a legacy router. Aggregated information from the OpenFlow controller which is sent towards the legacy router can reduce the utilization of these resources. Finally we proposed several algorithms and design models that can be implemented for route aggregation in Software-defined Networks.\\u00a0 Implementation of the solutions suggested in this thesis will allow automatic route aggregation in SDN.

LDAP is a protocol used by clients to retrieve information from a directory server.\\nThis report describes how an LDAP directory may be used to share user data in a computer network. First the concept of distributed directory information is presented. Then LDAP is carefully described and compared with X.500, a larger and more complex service. After that we look at the possibility to implement LDAP when developing own systems. Deployment issues and available LDAP products are discussed. A project demo system is presented and described. The demo system shows how different systems can share user information stored in an LDAP directory and how operating systems may be migrated with the directory.

These are only some of the factors that are causing growing concern for security in mobile communication.\\nToday there are several products for authentication and secure communication over the Internet. However, most algorithms and techniques were designed and optimised for stationary clients such as PCs, which have a high bandwidth network connection and endless power. Handheld devices with less memory, a less powerful CPU, and only narrow bandwidth network connection have more limited possibilities for security than stationary PCs.\\nThe purpose of this M.Sc Thesis was to examine the suitability of the existing techniques for authentication and secure communication for handheld devices in the mobile Internet.\\nEvaluation of different algorithms shows that the Rijndael algorithm and Elliptic Curves techniques are the most suitable ones for mobile devices. The security protocol I recommend today is SSL.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93284\", \"number-of-pages\": \"69\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-18T14:05:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-13T12:43:27.964+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:55:18.407+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93284\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 69.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:510489\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2009]]}, \"title\": \"Secure Context-Aware Mobile SIP User Agent\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Merha\", \"given\": \"Bemnet Tesfaye\", \"localId\": \"u10ug2m3\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Br\\u00e6k\", \"given\": \"Rolv\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"NTNU\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Hasnes\", \"given\": \"Geir\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"NTNU\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Context awareness is an important aspect of pervasive and ubiquitous computing. By utilizing contextual information gathered from the environment, applications can adapt to the user\\u2019s specific situation. In this thesis, user context is used to automatically discover multimedia devices and services that can be used by a mobile Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) user agent. The location of the user is captured using various sensing technologies to allow users of our SIP user agent to interact with network attached projectors, speakers, and cameras in a home or office environment.\\nIn order to determine the location of the user, we have developed and evaluated a context aggregation framework that gathers and analyzes contextual information from various sources such as passive infrared sensors, infrared beacons, light intensity, and temperature sensors. Once the location of the user is determined, the Service Location Protocol (SLP) is used to search for services. For this purpose, we have implemented a mobile SLP user agent and integrated it with an existing SIP user agent. The resulting mobile SIP user agent is able to dynamically utilize multimedia devices around it without requiring the user to do any manual configuration.\\nThis thesis also addressed the challenge of building trust relationship between the user agent and the multimedia services. We propose a mechanism which enables the user agent authenticate service advertisements before starting to redirect media streams. The measurements we have performed indicate that the proposed context aggregation framework provides more accurate location determination when additional sensors are incorporated. Furthermore, the performance measurements indicate that the delay incurred by introducing context awareness to the SIP user agent is acceptable for a small deployment such as home and office environment. In order to realize large scale deployments, future investigations are recommended to further improve the performance of the framework.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91499\", \"number-of-pages\": \"128\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2009:63\", \"keyword\": \"SIP; context-awareness; service discovery; trust establishment; SIP; kontext medvetenhet; tj\\u00e4nst uppt\\u00e4ckt; f\\u00f6rtroende etablering\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-16T14:00:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-16T12:14:33.900+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:22:29.159+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91499\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 128.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:513159\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2005]]}, \"title\": \"Secure data and voice over wireless networks in disaster and emergency response\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Vu Hoang\", \"given\": \"Tung\", \"localId\": \"u1mwxax3\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Gannon\", \"given\": \"Sarah\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Response\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Communication is often limited in a disaster area and other emergency situations where no infrastructure exists or existing infrastructure has been destroyed.

Today supervisory control and data acquisition systems utilizing network connected programmable logic controllers are widely used in many industries and critical infrastructures. These network-attached devices have been under increasing attack for some time by malicious attackers (including in some cases possibly government supported efforts).This thesis evaluates currently available solutions to mitigate these attacks.

Moreover, the experiments show that the distribution time depends primarily on network latency rather than the time required to split the cryptographic key in chunks; hence the approach is usable in practice.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-240425\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xxi,74\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2018:764\", \"keyword\": \"LTE; VoLTE; LBO; Lawful Intercept; Multiple Escrow Agents; Shamir\\u2019s Secret Sharing; LTE; VoLTE; LBO; laglig avlyssning; flera \\\"Escrow Agents\\\"; Shamirs krypteringsmetod\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-12-21T07:08:30.029+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-12-19T09:00:27.515+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T18:00:43.823+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-240425\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 95.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:643035\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2013]]}, \"title\": \"Securing Safebook : Secure Data Access Control and Key Management for Safebook\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Ali\", \"given\": \"Waqas Liaqat\", \"localId\": \"u1jo2ekk\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"\\u00d6nen\", \"given\": \"Melek \\u00d6nen\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Institut Eur\\u00e9com\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Cutillo\", \"given\": \"Leucio Antonio\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Institut Eur\\u00e9com\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Online social networks have become a fast and efficient way of sharing information and experiences. Over the past few years the trend of using social networks has drastically increased with an enormous amount of users\\u2019 private contents injected into the providers\\u2019 data centers. This has raised concerns about how the users\\u2019 contents are protected and how the privacy of users is preserved by the service providers. Moreover, current social networks have been subject to much criticism over their privacy settings and access control mechanism. The providers own the users\\u2019 contents and these contents are subject to potential misuse. Many socially engineered attacks have exposed user contents due to the lack of sufficient privacy and access control. These security and privacy threats are addressed by Project Safebook, a distributed peer-to-peer online social networking solution leveraging real life trust. By design Safebook decentralizes data storage and thus the control over user content is no longer in the service provider\\u2019s hands. Moreover, Safebook uses an anonymous routing technique to ensure communication privacy between different users.This thesis project addresses privacy aware data management for Safebook users and a data access control solution to preserve users\\u2019 data privacy and visibility utilizing a peer to peer paradigm. The solution focuses on three sub-problems: (1) preserving the user\\u2019s ownership of user data, (2) providing an access control scheme which supports fine grained access rights, and (3) secure key management. In our proposed system, the user profile is defined over a collection of small data artifacts. An artifact is the smallest logical entity of a profile. An artifact could be a user\\u2019s status tweak, text comment, photo album metadata, or multimedia contents. These artifacts are then logically arranged to form a hierarchical tree, call the User Profile Hierarchy. The root of the profile hierarchy is the only entry point exposed by Safebook from where the complete user profile can be traversed. The visibility of portions of the user profile can be defined by exposing a subset of profile hierarchy. This requires limiting access to child artifacts, by encrypting the connectivity information with specific access keys. Each artifact is associated with a dynamic access chain, which is an encrypted string and contains the information regarding the child nodes. A dynamic access chain is generated using a stream cipher, where each child\\u2019s unique identifier is encrypted with its specific access key and concatenated to form the dynamic access chain. The decryption process will reveal only those child artifacts whose access keys are shared. The access keys are managed in a hierarchical manner over the profile hierarchy. Child artifacts inherit the parent\\u2019s access key or their access key can be overridden with a new key. In this way, fine grained access rights can be achieved over a user\\u2019s artifacts. Remote users can detect changes in a specific branch of a profile hierarchy and fetch new artifacts through our proposed profile hierarchy update service. On top of the proposed access control scheme, any social networking abstraction (such as groups, circles, badges, etc.) can be easily implemented.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-126987\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xv,101\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:199\", \"keyword\": \"User Privacy; Access Control; Distributed Social Networks; Key Management; Anv\\u00e4ndarnas Privatliv; Atkomstkontroll; Distribuerade Sociala N\\u00e4tverk; Nyckelhantering\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-09-23T15:57:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-08-25T16:48:14.372+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T23:35:20.668+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-126987\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 116.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1147703\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2017]]}, \"title\": \"Security Analysis of Ethernet in Cars\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Talic\", \"given\": \"Ammar\", \"localId\": \"u1vdfb7q\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Hocke\", \"given\": \"Roland\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Vector Informatik GmbH Stuttgart, Germany\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"With the development of advanced driving assistance systems, the amount of data that needs to be transmitted within a car has increased tremendously.

In that time several vulnerabilities of the networking protocol stack implementations and even the protocols themselves have been discovered. The knowledge from exploiting computer networks can be applied to the automotive domain. Additionally, vehicle manufacturers tend to implement their own stacks, due to copyleft reasons; hence the chances of implementation faults increases as opposed to using well-tested open source solutions.

It starts with an introduction to computer and automotive networking and protocols. After a solid foundation is laid, it investigates what makes up automotive Ethernet, its application in the field, and the automotive specific components relying on it. After looking at related work, a data network security audit and analysis as defined by the open-source security testing methodology is performed. The system is graded with risk assessment values. Weak points are identified and improvements suggested. The impact of the proposed improvements is shown by reevaluating the system and recalculating the risk assessment values.These efforts further the ultimate goal of achieving increased safety of all traffic participants.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-215329\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xvi,81\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2017:180\", \"keyword\": \"Automotive security; penetration testing; automotive Ethernet; TCP/IP; DoIP; BroadR-Reach; OSSTMM; flash bootloader; Ethernet f\\u00f6r fordon; TCP/IP; Ethernet s\\u00e4kerhet; DoIP; BroadR-Reach; OSSTMM; flash bootloader\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-10-13T09:20:10.437+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-10-07T14:53:02.315+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T23:58:09.625+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-215329\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 97.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:456509\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2011]]}, \"title\": \"Security as a Service in Cloud for Smartphones\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Subramanian\", \"given\": \"Lakshmi\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": null, \"abstract\": \"Smartphone usage has been continuously growing in recent times.

In this thesis, we will look at the next step in the virtualization revolution, the virtualized network. Software-defined networking (SDN) is a relatively new concept that is moving the field towards a more software-based solution to networking. Today when a packet is forwarded through a network of routers, decisions are made at <i>each </i>router as to which router is the next hop destination for the packet. With SDN these decisions are made by a centralized SDN controller that decides upon the best path and instructs the devices along this path as to what action each should perform. Taking SDN to its extreme minimizes the physical network components and increases the number of virtualized components. The reasons behind this trend are several, although the most prominent are simplified processing and network administration, a greater degree of automation, increased flexibility, and shorter provisioning times. This in turn leads to a reduction in operating expenditures and capital expenditures for data center owners, which both drive the further development of this technology.Virtualization has been gaining ground in the last decade. However, the initial introduction of virtualization began in the 1970s with server virtualization offering the ability to create several virtual server instances on one physical server. Today we already have taken small steps towards a virtualized network by virtualization of network equipment such as switches, routers, and firewalls. Common to virtualization is that it is in early stages all of the technologies have encountered trust issues and general concerns related to whether software-based solutions are as rugged and reliable as hardwarebased solutions. SDN has also encountered these issues, and discussion of these issues continues among both believers and skeptics. Concerns about trust remain a problem for the growing number of cloud-based services where multitenant deployments may lead to loss of personal integrity and other security risks. As a relatively new technology, SDN is still immature and has a number of vulnerabilities. As with most software-based solutions, the potential for security risks increases. This thesis investigates how denial-of-service (DoS) attacks affect an SDN environment and a singlethreaded controller, described by text and via simulations.The results of our investigations concerning trust in a multi-tenancy environment in SDN suggest that standardization and clear service level agreements are necessary to consolidate customers\\u2019 confidence. Attracting small groups of customers to participate in user cases in the initial stages of implementation can generate valuable support for a broader implementation of SDN in the underlying infrastructure. With regard to denial-of-service attacks, our conclusion is that hackers can by target the centralized SDN controller, thus negatively affect most of the network infrastructure (because the entire infrastructure directly depends upon a functioning SDN controller). SDN introduces new vulnerabilities, which is natural as SDN is a relatively new technology. Therefore, SDN needs to be thoroughly tested and examined before making a widespread deployment.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-177394\", \"number-of-pages\": \"49\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2014:161\", \"keyword\": \"Software Defined Networks (SDN); network security; denial of service; distributed denial of service; multi-tenancy; mjukvarudefinierat n\\u00e4tverk; n\\u00e4tverkss\\u00e4kerhet; \\u00f6verbelastningsattack; distribuerad \\u00f6verbelastningsattack; multitenans\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-11-19T16:19:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-11-19T14:33:16.964+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T11:38:07.668+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-177394\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 49.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1613886\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2021]]}, \"title\": \"Security Evaluation of Damper System\\u2019s Communication and Update Process : Threat modeling using vehicleLang and securiCAD\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Ekelund\", \"given\": \"Joar\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879223\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r elektroteknik och datavetenskap (EECS)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Lagerstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Robert\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0003-3089-3885\", \"localId\": \"u139ne4r\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879231\", \"name\": \"KTH, N\\u00e4tverk och systemteknik\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"As the automotive industry becomes increasingly reliant on digital systems it is of utmost importance that these systems are secure.

A systematic literature study was performed to identify known vulnerabilities of similar systems as well as potential cybersecurity solutions. A threat model was constructed using vehicleLang, the Meta Attack Language, and securiCAD. The model was created utilizing preexisting assets from vehicleLang and a newly implemented Bluetooth asset. The result from the systematic literature study was used to validate preexisting attack steps and also to create the Bluetooth asset. To validate the model, experts in the field of automotive security and/or threat modeling were asked to assess the model. Using Cochran\\u2019s Equation, a target of eight expert evaluations were decided. Unfortunately, only seven evaluations were obtained, equivalent to an increase in the error margin from 25% to 26.6%. However, of the seven expert evaluations obtained none indicated the existence of critical flaws within the model. The model was therefore considered a good reflection of the damper system and its security aspects. Critical defenses included the utilization of cryptography, mutual authentication, and on-the-fly decryption. These defenses were shown to prevent unauthorized modifications of firmware and protect \\u00d6hlins intellectual property in form of source code.

The most important feature is that the computing resources are available whenever they are needed. Additionally, users pay only for the resource they actually use.

The goal of this thesis is to provide security in a system, being developed in another Master\\u2019s thesis project, to implement the ifoodbag web application in a cloud. To achieve this goal, we began by identifying the risks, threats, and vulnerabilities in the system model proposed by these other students for their implementation. A study was made of several different security mechanisms that might reduce or eliminate risks and secure the most vulnerable points in the proposed system\\u2019s design. Tests of these alternatives were conducted to select a set of mechanisms that could be applied to the proposed system\\u2019s design.

In this thesis we secure a home router and describe these steps to enable home and small business owners to secure their IPv6 network at a relatively low cost.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98295\", \"number-of-pages\": \"47\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2012:118\", \"keyword\": \"IPv6; security; home networks; small and medium sized enterprises\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-29T09:03:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-22T11:21:06.992+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:08:50.895+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-98295\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 47.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:516976\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2000]]}, \"title\": \"Security in Wireless LAN Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Moioli\", \"given\": \"Fabio\", \"localId\": \"u1yac4jw\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Melen\", \"given\": \"Riccardo\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Politecnico di Milano\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Johnsson\", \"given\": \"Martin\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Business Networks\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Rinman\", \"given\": \"Martin\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Business Networks\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Wireless LAN technology offers high-speed, wireless connectivity that enables mobile computing in many different environments. Many new services will be provided by usage of wireless LANs in public, home and corporate scenarios. Example of remote services might be downloading a video stream from a remote server or accessing news from an e-magazine. Local services could consist in travel information at airports, hotel-facilities at hotels, and conference-update at conference centers, as well as buying a fresh drink in a store. Present wireless networks are based on IEEE 802.11 standard, operating in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz ISM band and providing a bitrate of 2 Mbps. A new version of the 802.11 standard (802.11b) already now allows a bitrate of up to 11 Mbps. Work is now in progress for a new high performance wireless LAN standard with initial data rates up to 54 Mbps. It will operate in the license free 5 GHz band, which is globally available.\\nSupport for IP mobility is also on the verge of hitting the market on a broad scale. The requirement for this feature stems from the fact that terminals such as laptops, notebooks, and even palmtops, are on their way to regularly being connected to LANs by means of previous wireless interface. In a longer term, IP mobility is also seen as a requirement for the next generation of cellular networks and (of course) also for next generation of wireless LANs, e.g. those based on the HiperLAN/2 technology. While Mobile IP should be part of an overall mobility suit solution, it is best used selectively and in pop-up mode (i.e. using DHCP to obtain addresses) instead of using a Foreign Agent. Using Foreign Agents may in fact add additional complexity to the network, which may already be using DHCP. Both Wireless LAN systems deployed today and the Mobile IP solutions specified by the IETF mobility working group implement and define different levels and parts of an overall security architecture. Current solutions lack an analysis of the security framework regarding requirements that would apply for the private, public, domestic, and VPN networking cases, which are quite different in their nature.\\nThe main goal of this thesis has consisted in analysing and defining several security proposals for future wireless LAN network scenarios. Advanced services, such as IP mobility, accounting support for roaming, VPN services, and a secure interface for dynamic assignment of IP addresses to mobile terminals (e.g. through DHCP or DRCP), have also been integrated in the overall framework.

The wide adoption of video surveillance systems by various businesses and individuals has raised some vital security issues. \\u00a0Appropriately addressing these security issues is of great importance for video surveillance systems, as these systems may capture sensitive personal data and may attract numerous attacks. As of today nearly all devices have become networked (or are on their way to being connected to networks), hence eavesdropping is a common attack which can exploit a breach of a system\\u2019s security and result in data disclosure to unauthorised parties, video stream alterations, interference, and reduction of a system\\u2019s performance. Moreover, it is important that video surveillance systems are standardized by appropriate standardization organizations in order to assure high quality of the security services that utilize these systems and to facilitate interoperability.In this master thesis project rules and regulations concerning personal data protection were studied in order to define the requirements of the proposed robust and high quality security scheme that is to be integrated into video surveillance systems. This security scheme provides United States Federal Information (FIPS)* compliant security services by securing the communication channel between the system\\u2019s devices. The authentication of the system\\u2019s devices is established by using certificates and key exchanges. The proposed security scheme has been scrutinized in order to analyze its performance (and efficiency) in terms of overhead, increased jitter, and one-way delay variations.&lt;p&gt; Our implementation of the proposed security scheme utilized OpenVPN to provide privacy, integrity and authentication to the video streaming captured by Veracity\\u2019s clients and stored in Veracity\\u2019s proprietary NAS device (COLDSTORE). Utilization of OpenSSL FIPS Object module develops our security scheme in a FIPS compliant solution. For testing purposes, we created different test scenarios and collected data about the total delivery time of a video file, delivered from the IPCamera/NVR/DVR devices to the COLDSTORE device, the network overhead and lastly the one-way delay between the two endpoints.Another area of interest that we focus on is how to deploy certificates to new, existing, and replacement devices; and how this deployment may affect the system\\u2019s security design. In addition, we investigate the problems arising when a secured video stream needs to be played back via another device outside of our system\\u2019s network.The results of the thesis will be used as an input for product development activities by the company that hosted this thesis project.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-143490\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiv,55\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2014:6\", \"keyword\": \"Video surveillance Systems; security; FIPS; OpenVNP; Video\\u00f6vervakningssystem; s\\u00e4kerhet; FIPS; OpenVPN\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-03-21T13:03:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-03-21T12:09:33.155+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T20:37:06.221+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-143490\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 69.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:949971\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2016]]}, \"title\": \"Security Management : Fulfillment of the Government Requirements for a component assurance process\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Kukuruzovic\", \"given\": \"Naida\", \"localId\": \"u1tfridt\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Muhovic\", \"given\": \"Admir\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Swedish Armed Forces\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Protecting organization\\u2019s assets from various security threats is a necessity for every organization. Efficient security management is vital to effectively protect the organization\\u2019s assets. However, the process of implementing efficient security management is complex and needs to address many requirements.The problem that this master\\u2019s thesis project addressed was to propose a component assurance process for the Swedish Armed Forces. This process has to be followed in order for a solution or product to be approved at a specific component assurance level. This problem was solved by first performing market research regarding security management. Various security management approaches were examined and the top security management solutions were selected. These solutions were then compared with the assurance requirements stated in Swedish Armed Forces\\u2019 KSF v3.1 (Swedish: \\u201cKrav p\\u00e5 IT-s\\u00e4kerhetsf\\u00f6rm\\u00e5gor hos IT-system\\u201d, English: Requirements for IT security capabilities of IT systems). This documentation lists the requirements for information technology (IT) security capabilities of IT systems. The solution that satisfied the most of these requirements was selected and modified in order to satisfy the full set of requirements. Finally, a component assurance process is proposed. This process may be used to decide which solutions or products can be used, along with the manner in which each solution or product should be used. The impact of having a component assurance process is that all the solutions and products are approved to a specific component assurance level exclusively based on this process. The ability to include such requirements in the acquisition of any product or service provides the Swedish Armed Forces with assurance that all products or services are approved to specific assurance levels in the same manner and hence provides the Swedish society with assurance that procedures within the Swedish Armed Forces are documented and protect the interests of the country and its citizens.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-189983\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xv,233\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2016:110\", \"keyword\": \"Security management; information security; authentication; authorization; governance; risk management; compliance; user management; S\\u00e4kerhetshantering; informationss\\u00e4kerhet; autentisering; auktorisering; styrning; riskhantering; f\\u00f6ljsamhet; anv\\u00e4ndaradministration\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2016-08-08T15:21:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2016-07-26T12:54:22.054+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-22T16:05:24.407+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-189983\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 248.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:634369\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2013]]}, \"title\": \"Security of NFC applications\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Pham\", \"given\": \"Thi Van Anh\", \"localId\": \"u198q5w4\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Aura\", \"given\": \"Tuomas\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Aalto University\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Tamrakar\", \"given\": \"Sandeep\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Aalto University\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Near Field Communication (NFC) refers to a communication technology that enables an effortless connection and data transfers between two devices by putting them in a close proximity. Besides contactless payment and ticketing applications, which were the original key drivers of this technology, a large number of novel use cases can benefit from this rapidly developing technology, as has been illustrated in various NFC-enabled application proposals and pilot trials.Typical NFC-enabled systems combine NFC tags, NFC-enabled mobile phones, and online servers. This thesis explores the trust relationships, security requirements, and security protocol design in these complex systems. We study how to apply the security features of different types of NFC tags to secure NFC applications. We first examine potential weaknesses and problems in some novel use cases where NFC can be employed. Thereafter, we analyze the requirements and propose our system design to secure each use case. In addition, we developed proof-of-concept implementations for two of our proposed protocols: an NFCenabled security-guard monitoring system and an NFC-enabled restaurant menu.For the former use case, we also formally verified our proposed security protocol.\\u00a0 Our analysis shows that among the discussed tags, the NFC tags based on secure memory cards have the least capability and flexibility. Their built-in three-pass mutual authentication can be used to prove the freshness of the event when the tag is tapped. The programmable contactless smart cards are more flexible because they can be programmed to implement new security protocols. In addition, they are able to keep track of a sequence number and can be used in systems that do not require application-specific software on the mobile phone. The sequence number enforces the order of events, thus providing a certain level of replay prevention. The most powerful type of tag is the emulated card since it provides a clock, greater computational capacity, and possibly its own Internet connection, naturally at higher cost of deployment.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-124368\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xii,88\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:125\", \"keyword\": \"NFC; security protocol; DESFire; Java card; card emulation; restaurant; vending machine; class attendance; security guard; NFC; s\\u00e4kerhetsprotokoll; DESFire; Java kort; kort emulering; restaurang; varuautomat; s\\u00e4kerhetsvakt\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-07-01T09:06:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-06-30T12:59:57.563+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T23:55:49.364+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-124368\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 100.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:515385\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2002]]}, \"title\": \"Selecting/realization of Virtual Private Networks with Multiprotocol Label Switching or Virtual Local Area Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"\\u00d6gren\", \"given\": \"Niklas\", \"localId\": \"u1tsypjb\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Eriksson\", \"given\": \"Peter\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Arrowhead\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Many reports have been written about the techniques behind Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS). They usually deal with the low level design of the software implementing a specific technique. The initial products are usually not mature enough to run in a large network or have to be adjusted in some way to fit.\\nThis report investigates the different ways of implementing strict layer 2 Virtual Private Networks in an existing nation-wide Gigabit Ethernet. The infrastructure in use, as well as the hardware, has to be used without major changes. Since 1998/1999, when MPLS first started in the laboratories, development has continued. Today it is possible to introduce MPLS or tunneled national virtual local area network into an existing network. This requires high speed, fault tolerant, and stable hardware and software.\\nGoing beyond the separation of traffic at layer 3 using Virtual Private Networks, i.e., IPSec, we can tunnel layer 2 traffic through a network. Although the first layer 3 VPN products are already in use, layer 2 VPNs still need to be evaluated and brought into regular use. There are currently two ways of tunneling VLANs in a core network: tunneled VLANs (or as Extreme Networks calls them, VMANs) and MPLS.\\nThis project showed that it is possible to start with a VLAN-only solution, and then upgrade to MPLS to solve scalability issues. The VMAN solution can not be used at Arrowhead, since there are too many disadvantages in the way Extreme Networks has implemented it. However, a mix of tunneling VMAN in a VLAN core is possible, and enables customer tagging of VLANs in a Layer 2 VPN. Furthermore, the testing of EAPS and per-VLAN Spanning Tree Protocol turned out well, and showed that EAPS should not be used when there is more than one loop.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93211\", \"number-of-pages\": \"65\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": \"VPN (Virtual Private Network); VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network); MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-13T14:59:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-12T16:27:02.880+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:56:27.294+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93211\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 65.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:541067\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2004]]}, \"title\": \"Service discovery for Personal Area Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Ayrault\", \"given\": \"C\\u00e9cile\", \"localId\": \"u1iw7ey5\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Kanter\", \"given\": \"Theo\", \"affiliation\": []}, {\"family\": \"Wennlund\", \"given\": \"Andreas\", \"affiliation\": []}], \"abstract\": \"With the increasing use of electronic devices, the need for affordable wireless services specifically context-aware services, in a so-called Personal Area Network (PAN) is becoming an area with significant potential.

Nowadays, VoIP is becoming more and more popular. People use VoIP to call their family and friends every day. It is cheap, especially when users are abroad, because that they do need to pay any roaming fee. Many companies also like their employees to use VoIP, not only because the cost of calling is cheap, but using VoIP means that the company does not need a hardware Private Branch eXchange (PBX) -- while potentially offering all of the same types of services that such a PBX would have offered. As a result the company can replace their hardware PBX with a powerful PC which has Private Branch eXchange PBX software to connect all the employees and their VoIP provider.\\nAt the VoIP provider\\u2019s side, the provider can provide cheap calls for all users which are connected by Internet. The users can initialize and tear down a session using a VoIP user agent, but how can they place a VoIP call from a mobile device or other devices without a VoIP user agent? Users want to place cheap VoIP call everywhere. VoIP providers want to provide flexible solution to attract and keep users. So they both want to the users to be able to place cheap VoIP call everywhere. Although VoIP user agent are available for many devices as a software running on a computer, a hardware VoIP phone, and even in some mobile devices. However, there are some practical problems with placing a VoIP call from everywhere. The first problem is that not every device can have a VoIP user agent. But if you do not have a VoIP user agent on your device, then it would seem to be difficult to place a VoIP call. The second problem is that you have to connect to a network (probably Internet) to signal that you want to place a call. Thus at a minimum your device has to support connecting to an appropriate network. If your device is connecting to a mobile network, you can send signaling to set up a VoIP call through General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). However, the bandwidth and delay of the GPRS networks of some mobile operators is not suitable for the transfer of encoded voice data, additionally, some mobile operators charge high fees for using GPRS. All of these problems make placing VoIP calls via a mobile device difficult. However, if your mobile device has a VoIP user agent and you have suitable connectivity, then you can easily use VoIP from your mobile device[.]\\nTo provide a flexible solution to VoIP everywhere -- even to devices that do not or can not have a VoIP user agent, Opticall AB has designed Dial over Data (DoD) solution. By using this solution, you can place a VoIP call from your mobile device or even fixed phone -- without requiring that the device that you use have a VoIP user agent. This solution also provides a central Internet Protocol-Private Branch eXchange (IP-PBX) which can connect call to and from to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) phones. Both individuals and companies can use this solution for call cost savings.\\nMax Weltz created the existing DoD solution in an earlier thesis project. This thesis [1] provides a good description of the existing DoD solution. As a result of continued testing and user feedback, Opticall AB has realized that their DoD solution needs to be improved in several area. This thesis project first identified some of the places where improvement was needed, explains why these improvements are necessary, and finally designs, implements, and evaluates these changes to confirm that they are improvements. An important result of this thesis project was a clear demonstration of improvements in configuration of the solution, better presentation of call data records, correct presentation of caller ID, and the ability to use a number of different graphical user interfaces with the improve DoD solution. These improvements should make this solution more attractive to the persons who have to maintain and operate the solution.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91493\", \"number-of-pages\": \"56\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2009:104\", \"keyword\": \"VoIP; SIP; Asterisk; Symbian; JavaEE; JBoss; DoD\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-16T12:00:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-16T11:34:35.991+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:22:37.626+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91493\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 56.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:514606\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2004]]}, \"title\": \"Service Policy Management for User-Centric Services in Heterogeneous Mobile Networks,\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Avgeropoulos\", \"given\": \"Konstantinos\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Kanter\", \"given\": \"Theo G.\", \"localId\": \"u10l6taa\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Research\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Wennlund\", \"given\": \"Andreas\", \"localId\": \"u1al7w08\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6215\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a signaling protocol for IP-based media services that will be the de facto standard for future media-over-IP services.

The Signaling System number 7 (SS7) is used in fixed and wireless networks and is needed for call control and services such as caller ID, roaming, and for sending SMS. The traditional SS7 networks are expensive to lease and to expand, hence a new suite of protocols have been designed to carry signaling messages over IP. This suite contains a transport protocol called Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) and various user adaptation layer protocols such as M2PA, M2UA, M3UA, and SUA. To transport the highly loss and delay sensitive signaling messages over IP, it is mandatory that the transport protocol meets the high performance requirements of SS7. Not before the IP-solution has been tested in detail, will it replace significant parts of the national telephone network.In this thesis, the failover duration in the case of link failure was tested using the feature of SCTP called multi-homing.

IP-telephony solutions exist already in some business buildings as a replacement for PSTN or on the Internet as IP-to-IP telephony. However, before IP-telephony will be a realistic replacement for PSTN two major problems must be solved though; billing and guarantee of the expected QoS. Without the possibility of revenue no company would like to invest money and without QoS no customer will want to replace PSTN with IP-telephony. IP-to-IP telephony exists with best effort traffic for free today, and it will not be possible to charge for it in the future. By introducing value-added features such as PSTN gateway connection, bandwidth reservation and services such as call screening and redirecting, a way of charging the customer is presented in this report.\\nThe payment solution developed in this thesis is based on SIP and Jalda. The system is built in modules, all with a specific task, hence creating a distributed system, which does not depend on a central part, and following existing standards, avoiding a proprietary solution. It is also general enough to support other types of media than speech, enabling several business ideas including video on demand.\\nSecurity has to be considered seriously when dealing with Internet payments. The solution presented contains both the advantages of SIP with authentication and message encryption, as well as authentication and accounting by Jalda. Authorization is not a problem, as no one will get access to the services without paying, and anyone willing to pay will be granted access. It ends up being a distributed payment solution.\\nSIP has the necessary characteristics for constructing billing solutions. As payment seems to be a solvable problem there remains one major difficulty with IP-telephony.

Today Network address translation (NAT) traversal has become the main obstruction for future VoIP deployment.\\nIn this thesis we analyze and compare the existing NAT traversal solutions. Following this, we introduce a VoIP over IPSec (VOIPSec) solution (i.e., a VoIP over IPSec virtual private network (VPN) scheme) and an extended VOIPSec solution mechanism. These two solutions were tested and compared to measure their performance in comparison to a version of the same Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) user agent running without IPSec.\\nIn the proposed VOIPSec solution, the IPSec VPN tunnel connects each of the SIP clients to a SIP server, thus making all of the potential SIP participants reachable, i.e., solving the NAT traversal problem. All SIP signaling and media traffic for VoIP calls are transmitted through this prior established tunnel. This VPN tunnel provides the desired universal means for VoIP traffic to traverse NAT equipment. Additionally, the IPSec VPN also guarantees the security of VoIP calls at the IP level.\\nIn order to improve the security level of media streams for the VOIPSec solution, we deployed and evaluated an extended VOIPSec solution which provides end-to-end protection of the real time media traffic. In this extended VOIPSec solution, we used SRTP instead of RTP to carry the media content. This extended method was shown to provide all of the advantages of VOIPSec and SRTP without any additional delay for the media traffic (as compared to the VoIPSec solution).\\nNote that the solution proposed in this thesis may be of limited practical importance in the future as more NATs become VoIP capable; but the solution is currently essential for facilitating the increasing deployment of VoIP systems in practice. For VoIP calls that do not need end-to-end security, we recommend the use of the VOIPSec solution as a means to solve the NAT traversal problem and to protect traffic at the IP level. When application to application security is not needed we prefer the VOIPSec solution to the extended VOIPSec solution for the following reasons: (1) our test results show that the time for call setup for the extended VOIPSec solution is twice time the time needed for the VOIPSec solution and the extended VOIPSec solution requires the use of user agents that support SRTP. While, the VOIPSec solution does not require a special user agent and all VoIP clients in the market are compatible with this solution. However, when more SIP user agents add support for SRTP, the extended VOIPSec solution will be applicable for users of these SIP user agents.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91491\", \"number-of-pages\": \"55\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2009:105\", \"keyword\": \"VOIPSec; NAT; IPSec; SIP; SRTP; VPN\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-16T14:42:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-16T11:06:54.056+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:22:44.659+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91491\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 55.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:540129\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"Small Cell Wireless Backhaul in Mobile Heterogeneous Networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Legonkov\", \"given\": \"Pavel\", \"localId\": \"u1xqut4h\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Prokopov\", \"given\": \"Vasily\", \"localId\": \"u1bcsk9j\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Welin\", \"given\": \"Annikki\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Small cells are deployed in a crowded areas with a high demand for both coverage and capacity.

The performance of wireless equipment manufactured by several vendors has been measured. The results of these measurements were analyzed and compared to a set of requirements established for small cell backhaul. The analysis has affirmed that IEEE 802.11n is capable of providing sufficient performance to be used for small cell backhaul in various deployment scenarios.

In addition to protecting the backhaul link itself, the security research investigated the safety of the whole mobile network architecture remodeled with the introduction of small cells. A mechanism to integrate secure small cells into a mobile network was developed.The results obtained during the project will be used as an input for product development activities in the company hosting the project.

The idea of the project concerns how to increase production packaging efficiency by introducing a control system. After taking an in-depth look at the current production environment, the following system goals were defined: packaging time reduction, cost reduction, decrease in human errors, and reducing the number of customer complaints. To achieve these goals, the thesis project was divided into the following tasks: discovering a feasible solution, actual system development, testing, and evaluation. The proposed system is based on hardware (i.e. barcode scanner, and barcode printer) integrated with customized control software. The barcode scanner acts as a bridge between the system and the production process by scanning a barcode printed on each product. The system prints the required information label for the product\\u2019s package according to the scanned product. This label is pasted on the product\\u2019s box and is used as a tracking tool during further production steps. The system is very flexible and suits any packaging model. Other functional properties maintained in the system include data security, product traceability, and real time production monitoring. Testing of the system was done in an actual production environment at an Oberthur Technologies manufacturing site. Two production lines were selected to test the system\\u2019s functionality, specifically the SIM card production packaging line and the Scratch card/ Bank Card production packaging line. The results obtained during the evaluation phase of the proposed system show that the proposed solution decreased the packaging processing time by (27.3%) over the previous values.

As a result NFC has a huge potential to simplify our everyday tasks, ranging from paying for items to accessing our office or home.In this context we will focus on using NFC together with a Power over Ethernet (PoE) powered circuit board and NFC reader to realize a simple system for granting access to open a locked door.

These devices make use of the resources offered by Universal Mobile Telecommunication Services (UMTS) networks toaccess on-line services such as web browsing, e-mail, audio and video streaming, etc. UMTS networks have to deal with an increasing amount of data traffic generated by smartphones. Because of the fact that the smartphone is battery powered and is trying to satisfy the needs ofboth applications and human users there is a need to be smarter about how to manage both network and terminal resources.This thesis explores the possibility of making a better use of the network and terminal resources by exploiting correlations in the events of the smartphone-generated traffic. We propose a mechanism, through which the network can predict if a terminal is going to produce data transmission or reception in a near future, based on past events in its traffic. According to this prediction, the network will be able to decide if it keeps or releases the resources allocated to the terminal. We analyze the benefits from the network and the terminal point ofview. We also describe a method to estimate an upper bound of the time until the next transmission or reception of data in a near future.We show that it is possible a reduction of the time that each terminal wastes in its maximum power consumption state, but this reduction implies a penalty in the transmission/reception throughput of the terminal. The reduction is not uniform for all terminals: terminals whose traffic presents a predictable behavior gain the most. Estimates of upper bounds of time until the next transmission or reception are more accurate if they are made taking as input information about interarrival times of previous packets.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91051\", \"number-of-pages\": \"76\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2011:174\", \"keyword\": \"Smartphones; traffic patterns; UMTS\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-07T08:18:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-06T17:08:03.345+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:31:47.560+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91051\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 76.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:538921\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1994]]}, \"title\": \"SNMP Application for the MINT Router (Walkstation II project)\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Oelhafen\", \"given\": \"Markus\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Humblet\", \"given\": \"Pierre\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Institut EURECOM\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The purpose of the Walkstation II project is to create a testbed for a wireless communication system with access to the Internet.

Because of this people expect these social networking services to be available on their mobile device, as well as on their personal computer.

By integrating the contacts gained from the social networking service into the mobile phonebook the user can reach these contacts easily.\\nCommunication in online social networks via a mobile phone is expected to grow in popularity in the near future [1]. Several operators are simplifying access to these networks for their customers by offering different ways to connect to social networks [2][3]. However, access to these networks is often done via web sites or dedicated applications. These solutions are not optimal since browsing the web using a mobile browser can be bothersome and dedicated applications require installation of the application as well as any subsequent updates. Widgets on the other hand solve these problems in a convenient way. They can enable access to a device\\u2019s full functionality, just like dedicated applications, and provide a platform for easy development using web technologies. Furthermore, widgets are highly flexible for example, updates do not require reinstallation, and when new social networks become popular new widgets that connect to them can easily be developed and distributed.\\nThe goal of this thesis is to expand the mobile phonebook with functionality to enable communication on online social networks. To reach this goal I have created a new widget platform, where hybrid widgets run partly in a Java ME application and partly in the mobile web browser. This solution has the potential to significantly enhance the ways we communicate and interact with people.

It takes advantage of multiple built-in sensors, along with internet connectivity, to provide a variety of services including navigation, weather forecasts, media capturing/sharing, and many more. The smartphone has become a hub for our social interactions, ranging from traditional voice communications through messaging, to online social networking.There are endless possibilities for a new generation of applications that automatically adapts according to users\\u2019 social affinities. The key enabler is to understand the social profile of the user and to realize a Social Proximity Indicator (SPI). This indicator of a user\\u2019s social profile includes the user\\u2019s location, preferences, common friends, frequent interactions among friends, community membership, and many more attributes. This project addresses the exploitation of the user\\u2019s smartphone as a detector of these user\\u2019s social contexts in order to infer the social proximity between any 2 (or more) people. The goal of this social proximity indicator is to identify the (current) set of smartphone users that would want to participate in an application specific activity, such as media sharing, group conversation, etc. SPI identifies users based on their social interactions and common preferences.Based on this SPI, a photo sharing application is proposed and built for the Android smartphone platform. This application uses multiple physical and virtual sensors (hosted by the user\\u2019s smartphone) to determine the context of the user. After inferring this context, the application initiates photo sharing among an identified group sharing this context. The application, as well as the underlying code, theoretical concepts, and results are presented in this thesis. The experiments conducted during this thesis project indicate that it is feasible to build smartphone based social proximity based applications in which proximity incorporates much more than simply physical location, thus going beyond existing applications.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-147677\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xviii,95\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2014:66\", \"keyword\": \"Social Proximity; Smartphone; Social Interactions; Image sharing; Virtual Sensors; Social N\\u00e4rhet; Smartphone; sociala interaktioner; bild delning; virtuella sensorer\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-07-01T18:54:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2014-07-01T16:20:58.753+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T19:26:27.582+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-147677\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 113.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:608135\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2013]]}, \"title\": \"Socio-economic Impact of Fiber to the Home in Sweden\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Xiong\", \"given\": \"Ziyi\", \"localId\": \"u1x6i0yi\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Forzati\", \"given\": \"Marco\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Acreo AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) has been talked about since the introduction of fiberin the 1970s. It is nowadays shaping up to be the foundation of our newdigital society, bringing economic prosperity and a multitude of business,social, and entertainment opportunities to its users. The increased consumerdemand for high-speed network accessibility is being taken more and moreseriously and a fiber-based network is able to cope with these growing demandsdue to its wide bandwidth and reliability. Today there is a practical need forquantitative analysis regarding the socio-economic impacts of fiber-basedaccess networks. This analysis could be used as an indicator/reference for allthe stakeholder entities as they consider future investments anddevelopments. Sweden is a suitable target country for this analysis since ithas adopted fiber for some years and the benefits that FTTH has brought seemto already be tangible.The primary value of this thesis lies ininvestigation of its quantified evidence of the socio-economic impacts of FTTHdeployment in Sweden. This has been achieved based on data from the SwedishPost and Telecommunications Authority (PTS), Statistics Sweden (SCB), previousrelated studies, and information collected on-line from operators involved inthe fiber market, along with empirical analysis based on multivariateregression models.The results of the study show that fiber penetrationhas had a significant impact on the population\\u2019s evolution, specially the netamount of migration into a municipality, which indicates the attractiveness ofmunicipalities per se. It is therefore reasonable to suggest that localgovernment and local authorities take fiber deployment into consideration, ifthey want to attract people to stay for further local development. The studyalso analyzed the competition in fiber-based open networks and the prices ofsubscribing for 10/10 Mbps symmetrical Internet Service. Study findingsrevealed that networks with multiple competing service providers have a widerrange of services and a lower price: the more ISPs competing in a fibernetwork, the lower consumer prices. Specifically, for each new serviceprovider present in the network, there will be 5 SEK per month decrease of theaverage price of the Internet services, and an approximately 7 SEK per monthreduction in the lowest price.Nevertheless, a number of socio-economicimpacts remain unquantifiable as of the current time and due to the limitedavailable data.

These bugs are usually due to errors and mistakes made by programmers while writing the code or writing the specifications. No tool is able to detect all of these bugs. Some of these bugs remain undetected despite testing of the code. For these reasons, many researchers have tried to find indicators in the software\\u2019s source codes that can be used to predict the presence of bugs.Every bug in the source code is a potentially failure of the program to perform as expected. Therefore, programs are tested with many different cases in an attempt to cover all the possible paths through the program to detect all of these bugs. Early prediction of bugs informs the programmers about the location of the bugs in the code. Thus, programmers can more carefully test the more error prone files, and thus save a lot of time by not testing error free files.This thesis project created a tool that is able to predict error prone source code written in C++. In order to achieve this, we have utilized one predictor which has been extremely well studied: software metrics. Many studies have demonstrated that there is a relationship between software metrics and the presence of bugs. In this project a Neuro-Fuzzy hybrid model based on Fuzzy c-means and Radial Basis Neural Network has been used. The efficiency of the model has been tested in a software project at Ericsson. Testing of this model proved that the program does not achieve high accuracy due to the lack of independent samples in the data set.

Although these devices are personal, often a small set of persons can use a given device, for example a group of friends or a family.The most natural way to communicate for most humans is through speech. Therefore a natural way for these devices to know who is using them is for the device to listen to the user\\u2019s speech, i.e., to recognize the speaker based upon their speech.This project exploits the microphone built into most of these devices and asks whether it is possible to develop an effective speaker recognition system which can operate within the limited resources of these devices (as compared to a desktop PC). The goal of this speaker recognition is to distinguish between the small set of people that could share a handheld device and those outside of this small set. Therefore the criteria is that the device should work for any of the members of this small set and not work for anyone outside of this small set. Furthermore, within this small set the device should recognize which specific person within this small group is using it.An application for a Windows Mobile PDA has been developed using C++. This application and its underlying theoretical concepts, as well as parts of the code and the results obtained (in terms of accuracy rate and performance) are presented in this thesis. The experiments conducted within this research indicate that it is feasible to recognize the user based upon their speech is within a small group and further more to identify which member of the group is the user.

The radio spectrum is a limited resource regulated by governmental agencies according to a fixed spectrum assignment policy. However, many studies show that this fixed radio frequency allocation leads to significant underutilization of the radio spectrum creating artificial scarcity, as most of the allocated spectrum is not used all of the time in every location. To meet services growing demands, efficient use of the spectrum is essential. Therefore, there is a need to estimate the radio spectrum utilization in several locations and during different periods of time in order to opportunistically exploit the existing wireless spectrum. Cognitive radio technology aims to search for those portions of the radio spectrum that are assigned to a specific service, but are unused during a specific time and at specific location in order to share these white spaces and thus to reduce the radio spectrum inefficiency.In this thesis, we study spectrum utilization in the frequency range from 790MHz to 925MHz. The spectrum sensing has been realized using a number of specialized microcontroller based white space sensors which utilize energy detection, situated in different locations of a building in Kista, Sweden. The occupancy of the frequency bands in this chunk of the spectrum is quantified as the fraction of samples with a power level greater than a threshold. The results from these spectrum measurements show that a significant amount of spectrum in this scanned range around the building is inefficiently used all the time.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-124555\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xi,64\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:177\", \"keyword\": \"Cognitive radio; spectrum sensing; dynamic spectrum access; radio spectrum utilization; Kognitiv radio; spectrum sensing; dynamiskt spektrum tillg\\u00e5ng; radiospektrum utnyttjas\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-07-11T08:36:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-07-10T16:29:42.135+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T23:51:41.781+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-124555\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 75.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:513122\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2005]]}, \"title\": \"Speech Interface for a Mobile Audio Application\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Sverin\", \"given\": \"Johan\", \"localId\": \"u1mol7tc\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Today almost everyone owns a mobile phone, adults along with teenagers and kids.

The educational goal is to de-mystifying radio and other link and physical layer communication technologies as the students can follow packets from the higher layers down through the physical layer and back up again.\\nThe thesis fills the gap between the existing documentation for the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) resources and the knowledge of undergraduate students. This was necessary because the existing document is targeted at advanced audiences rather than undergraduates. This thesis describes the design and evolution of a workbench for students to experiment with a variety of media access and control protocols, much as Wireshark gives students the ability to watch network and higher layer protocols. Another motivation for this thesis is that an increasing number of communication networks use complex media access and control protocols and existing tools do not allow students to see the details of what is taking place in these protocols, except via simulation. Today an software defined radio and computer are affordable as laboratory equipment for an undergraduate course. Hence the time is ripe for the development of undergraduate laboratory course material using these tools.\\nThe thesis is targeted at (1) instructors of undergraduates who might use this work to develop their own lesson plans and course material and (2) students of physical and link layer protocols who want a practical tool for carrying out experiments in these layers. Hopefully by de-mystifying these lower layers and by making the USRP more approachable by undergraduate students we will encourage lots of students to view wireless network technology as being just as approachable as a wired Ethernet.\\nDue to the widespread use of wireless communications technologies, there is a great need by industry for more graduates who can understand communication systems from the physical to the application layer - rather than the current situation where there is a hard boundary between the lower two layers and the upper layers. While there has been a lot of research concerning cross layer optimization, much of this is theoretical and not very approachable by students. A desired outcome of this thesis project is that undergraduate students will be able to understand tradeoffs at all layers of the protocol stack and not be limited to the upper layers.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91193\", \"number-of-pages\": \"82\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2009:206\", \"keyword\": \"GNU Radio; USRP; MAC; Bluetooth; IEEE 802.11\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-09T14:54:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-09T14:45:47.711+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:28:49.816+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91193\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 82.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:528541\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1998]]}, \"title\": \"S.U.N.E. - Secure User Network Environment\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"H\\u00f6gstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Andreas\", \"localId\": \"u1vmo2kx\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}, {\"family\": \"\\u00c5sbrink\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"localId\": \"u1kcus38\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Mild\", \"given\": \"Michal\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"SoftWell AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"In today's society, an increasing number of people geographically apart need to communicate to each other in a secure manner.

Within these standards the role played by power consumption is implicit, hence power consumption needs to be as low as possible in order to fulfill long-life requirements and to offer the opportunity of locating and moving smart objects in the coverage area while relying only on batteries as the device's power source.\\u00a0 Considering the importance of identifying and tracking these smart objects with high accuracy and high precision, this document propose an implementation of an IEEE 802.15.4a MAC layer, exploiting ultra-wideband wireless technology, with a time synchronization algorithm included for precise Time Difference of Arrival indoor positioning.Nevertheless, this thesis demonstrates the advantages of using UWB for indoor wireless communication, due to its accuracy in localization and its robustness against interference.A demonstration network has been analyzed consisting of four main base stations optimistically displaced at the corners of a room gathering timestamps from a central tag moving within the space where the UWB signal is within range. These timestamps are collected in one of the base station which plays the role of the coordinator and sends this information to a server which computes the position of the tag using TDOA formulation.The main focus of this work is the synchronization algorithms used to synchronize the four base stations and secondly to synchronize the coordinator with the tag. Particular interest is placed on the protocol, the kind of messages exchanged, and the procedure used to maintain a good level of synchronization and to avoid unwanted clock drifts.Moreover the thesis gives some hints of potential future improvements and proposes a possible solution for large-scale scenarios involving the installation of additional base stations for higher coverage and integration of a larger number of tags, with a focus on synchronization, collision avoidance, and routing procedures to better Fit the situation of a larger network and more tags.\\u00a0 As a result, all the assumptions and the methodologies applied give evidence of how difficult it is to meet contemporary requirements for position accuracy, low power consumption, limited memory, and small message exchange when utilizing low-power and lossy networks and to address problems which need to be further studied in the future. The results of this thesis project offer a good proof of the possibility to reach high accuracy in terms of localization when exploiting UWB radio technology and redundant time synchronization algorithms with the help of TDOA measurements.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-120580\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xvii,79\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2013:59\", \"keyword\": \"IEEE 802.15.4a; synchronization; time delay of arrival; ultra-wideband; IEEE 802.15.4a; synkronisering; tidsf\\u00f6rdr\\u00f6jning f\\u00f6r ankomst; ultrabredbandsteknik\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-04-15T09:53:42.507+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2013-04-11T16:48:54.642+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T00:43:25.055+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-120580\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 96.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:402380\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2011]]}, \"title\": \"S\\u00e4ker grannuppt\\u00e4ck i IPv6\", \"language\": \"swe\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Huss\", \"given\": \"Philip\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The IPv6 protocol offers with some new functions, one of them is auto configuration. With auto configuration it is possible for nodes, i.e. hosts and routers, for automatically associated with IPv6 addresses without manual configuration. Auto configuration it is another protocol as it uses Neighbor Discovery protocol (ND) messages (ND is mandatory in the IPv6 stack). The main purpose of ND is that nodes can discover other nodes on the local link, perform address resolution, check that addresses are unique, and check the reachability with active nodes.There are exactly the same vulnerabilities of IPv6 as IPv4 and is now exception, ND if not properly secured. IPsec is a standard security mechanism for IPv6 but it does not solve the problem of secure auto configuration due the bootstrapping problem. Therefore the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) introduced Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND). SEND is a mechanism for authentication, message protection, and router authentication.

In some cases the partial ATCP implementation increases throughput but more often it causes an increased amount of duplicate retransmissions. In these scenarios it is unlikely that even a complete ATCP implementation would increase throughput performance.A few modifications to ATCP and TCP are analysed.

One reason why TCP might encounter problems in such an environment is rapid changes of the link characteristics. These rapid changes can occur due to handover between two subnetworks (macro handover), e.g., when a mobile node switches between different access networks. A possible and realistic handover scenario could be when a mobile node is roaming between a high bandwidth local area network (LAN) with limited coverage and a low bandwidth radio link with wide area coverage.\\nThe goals of this thesis were to set up a realistic environment for measurements of the handover performance of TCP, and to observe TCP behavior when the link characteristics suddenly change. Further objectives were to analyze the results and propose solutions for improving the performance.\\nThe mobility management in the measurement setup is handled by Mobile IP. Handovers are performed between a wireless LAN (WaveLAN) and a PPP link over a GSM circuit switched data connection. Our investigation shows that several spurious TCP timeouts occur after handover from the fast link to the slow link, triggering unnecessary retransmissions and hence resulting in TCP performance degradation. To avoid unnecessary retransmissions, we suggest a resetting of the retransmission timeout value (RTO) at the moment of handover.\\nIn the case of handover from the low bandwidth link (PPP) to the high bandwidth link (WaveLAN), our measurements show that queued packets in the link layer buffer continue to flow over the PPP link even after the handover. The high bandwidth available after the switch is thus poorly utilized before the buffer of the low bandwidth link has been emptied. The IP sending process should delay putting packets in the queue of a slow link, thus avoiding large link layer queues and enabling utilization of the high bandwidth link faster. This could be achieved by flow control between the IP layer and the link layer. After the packets have started flowing over the WaveLAN, the RTO value is unnecessarily high, which could result in extensive delays in the case of packet losses. To alleviate the problems we recommend resetting the RTO value or modifying the algorithm for calculating the RTO value to faster adapt to sudden and significant decrease of the round-trip time (RTT) in the case of handover.\\nIn both handover scenarios mentioned above we have found that a small window size is favorable to mitigate the negative effects due to the rapid changes of the link characteristics. The use of Active Queue Management to avoid large window sizes would be an interesting approach for future investigations. Another interesting approach could be to have flow control between the IP layer and the link layer to avoid a large link layer queue when the handover from [one link to another occurs.]\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95138\", \"number-of-pages\": \"55\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": \"TCP; mobile IP\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-20T16:28:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-05-14T14:08:37.241+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:36:17.844+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95138\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 55.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:528325\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"TCP/IP Packet Flow Analyser\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Pour Rajaei\", \"given\": \"Rama\", \"localId\": \"u1xfzijk\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Rimbark\", \"given\": \"Mattias\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Telecom AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"This is the final version of my thesis project: TCP/IP Packet Flow Analyser.

The Network Managers need this kind of \\u201ccontrol\\u201d over the network traffic to be able to deliver cost effective solutions for increasing network bandwidth and better allocation of bandwidth to users, proactively monitor critical network links i.e links that are in need of more bandwidth or that are \\u201cabnormally\\u201d faulty, computing resources used by a host or host pairs, etc.\\nTo be able to address these requirements and the fact that TCP/IP traffic is increasing, Ericsson Telecom AB which were developing an ATM Switch, called AXD 301, were very anxious to see if and how one can add the traffic flow analysing functionality to the switch by using an already existing circuit board. The design had to be adapted to the constrains of the circuit board, and thereby limited to a principle functionality of a traffic analyser. The analyser should also have the ability to send the collected data about the TCP/IP traffic to a regular work station equipped with an ATM card using a protocol specified by me.The functionality of the analyser was programmed in C and executed an embedded PowerPC.\\nThe main insufficiency of the current design was the packet analysing speed. It was able to run with a bandwidth of approximately 114 to 240 Mbps. To improve the performance in a packet analysing speed point of view, some alternative ways to implement the analyser with more help from the hardware was proposed.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95441\", \"number-of-pages\": \"40\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-20T16:32:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-05-24T17:58:54.604+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:30:00.118+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-95441\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 40.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:524296\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2012]]}, \"title\": \"Telecommunication Services\\u2019 Migration to the Cloud : Network Performance analysis\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Albarr\\u00e1n Munoz\", \"given\": \"Isaac\", \"localId\": \"u1zfon6l\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Parras Ruiz De Az\\u00faa\", \"given\": \"Manuel\", \"localId\": \"u1uklj56\", \"affiliation\": []}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Johansson\", \"given\": \"Leif Y.\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Tikekar\", \"given\": \"Nikhil\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Nowadays, telecommunication services are commonly deployed in private networks, which are controlled and maintained by the telecommunication operators themselves, by co-location services providers, or, to some extent, by their hardware and software providers.

The purpose of a compression algorithm is to decrease the size of a set of time series data (such as vehicle speed, wheel speed, etc.) so that the data to be transmitted from the vehicle is small size, thus decreasing the cost of transmission while providing potentially better offboard data analysis. The project helped improve the quality of data collected by the data analysts and reduced the cost of data transmission. Since the time series data compression mostly concerns data storage and transmission, the difficulties in this project were where to locate the combination of data compression and transmission, within the limited performance of the onboard embedded systems. These embedded systems have limited resources (concerning hardware and software resources). Hence the efficiency of the compression algorithm becomes very important. Additionally, there is a tradeoff between the compression ratio and real-time performance. Moreover, the error rate introduced by the compression algorithm must be smaller than an expected value. The compression algorithm contains two phases: (1) an online lossy compression algorithm - piecewise approximation to shrink the total number of data samples while maintaining a guaranteed precision and (2) a lossless compression algorithm \\u2013 Delta-XOR encoding to compress the output of the lossy algorithm. The algorithm was tested with four typical time series data samples from real CAN logs with different functions and properties. The similarities and differences between these logs are discussed. These differences helped to determine the algorithms that should be used. After the experiments which helped to compare different algorithms and check their performances, a simulation is implemented based on the experiment results. The results of this simulation show that the combined compression algorithm can meet the need of certain compression ratio by controlling the error bound. Finally, the possibility of improving the compression algorithm in the future is discussed.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-239065\", \"number-of-pages\": \"76\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2018:722\", \"keyword\": \"Data compression; Data transmission; Time series data; IoT; CAN; Vehicle connectivity; Datakomprimering; Data\\u00f6verf\\u00f6ring; Tidsseriedata; IoT; CAN; Uppkopplade fordon\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-11-16T07:08:13.355+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-11-16T07:07:52.624+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T18:31:28.644+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-239065\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 76.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:516842\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2000]]}, \"title\": \"The Effect of Combining Network and Server QoS Parameters on End-to-End Performance\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Fey\", \"given\": \"Enik\\u00f6\", \"localId\": \"u1bg7y8h\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Rooney\", \"given\": \"Sean\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"IBM Z\\u00fcrich Research Laboratory\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Application hosting is becoming a popular business, Application Service Providers (ASPs) need however to keep up with the increasing pace of the market. This implies that they have to provide infrastructure to an increasing number of clients, and at the same time give QoS guarantees to these clients. One solution for ASPs to both guarantee a certain service level (QoS) for their clients and keep expanding would be to have so many resources as to be able to provide more than the maximum aggregate need of their clients. This may turn out to be an expensive or even an impossible solution - sharing infrastructure between clients and offering some means of resource reservation, and using charging to insure that clients only reserve the resources they need, is an alternative.\\nIt is however not an easy problem to solve, particularly if the procedure of adding new clients is to be automated, and the resources dynamically allocated. The ICorpMaker framework being developed at the IBM Zurich Research Laboratory offers a solution to the above named problems. In the ICorpMaker framework dynamic resource allocation is achieved by letting clients modify the amount of resources allocated to them in a simple manner, requesting more or less resources than their current allotment.\\nThe difficulty in achieving the end-to-end performance the client desires, lies in the fact that it is not certain how modifying resource allocation at the network respectively server level will combine and affect the end-to-end performance experienced by the end users of the service. The aim of this thesis project was to study the correlation between different network and server QoS parameters and the resulting end-to-end performance by making measurements. The results obtained from these measurements give an answer to the question of how to change the network and server resource allocations, when a client's application does not perform in a satisfactory way and hence the client requests more resources.

In contrast with the earlier generations of circuit-switched mobile networks, LTE is all-IP packet-switched network. Both voice and data are sent inside IP packets. Voice over IP (VoIP) is used to provide voice service to LTE users. The speech frames are encapsulated into real-time protocol (RTP) packets and sent over the network. The underlying UDP and IP layers prepend their headers to this small RTP packet resulting in a relatively high overhead. The small size of the RTP packets containing voice/audio leads to an overhead problem as the protocol overhead is in addition to the large LTE frame overhead, thus wasting network resources. This master\\u2019s thesis project proposes to multiplex RTP and data packets at the user\\u2019s device as a solution to reduce the overhead. Moreover, the capability of modern user devices to switch between several interfaces (such as LTE and WLAN), is taken into account and the multiplexing of multiple traffic flows or a single traffic flow are studied in the case of a vertical handover. Performance and cost metrics are used to evaluate different potential demultiplexing points, and then the best possible demultiplexing point is identified. The results of this evaluation show that several demultiplexing points can be used based on the operator\\u2019s needs. The increased packet payload size increases the energy efficiency of LTE and may avoid the need of the UE to switch to WLAN to save power. In addition, to ensure high quality of service for VoIP traffic, the simultaneous use of multiple interfaces is efficient if the multiplexer is enabled.

Furthermore, the client should present the content in an innovative way and allow the development of a mobile platform that could be supported based upon advertising, with an approach based on using information about the user (i.e. favorite places or profile details)as well as content-based advertising.In addition to the client application, the development of this subproject includes the development of a series of server-side utilities for the uploading and elaboration of publications on the server infrastructure.The document first reviews e-reading systems, focusing on the ePub file definition and e-reading solutions currently in use. The report then describes the Android OS development environment. The document then explains the implementation for both client and server side applications, giving a detailed overview of the chosen strategies and of the applications' structure. Finally the report concludes with a list of the achieved goals, a discussion on the project's limitations and then an exploration on what is the future for this client application.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91043\", \"number-of-pages\": \"63\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2011:249\", \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-07T08:29:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-06T15:47:37.281+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:32:01.222+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91043\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 63.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:468239\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2011]]}, \"title\": \"The Leaf Project : An E-Reading Platform Business Plan\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Botero Aristiz\\u00e1bal\", \"given\": \"Diego Fernando\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5994\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r informations- och kommunikationsteknik (ICT)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The publishing industry is rapidly changing, especially due to the commoditization of portable devices that enable ubiquitous access to information. E-publishing content is a business that is still in an early stage, which means that there are a lot of opportunities for start-ups to come up with innovative business models to challenge the traditional way of publishing content.The Leaf Project intends to create an e-reading platform that will offer the possibility to stream e-books to computers, tablets, and smartphones. Most options available in the market offer customers the option of buying e-publishing content on an individual basis. However, as seen in the music and movies industry, users tend to access pirate content, unless they see extra benefits in a paid service. Initially, the Leaf Project will offer free content, such as the public domain books that are part of the Project Gutenberg. This will allow us to get real market feedback and gain users. Users will be able to use the platform to publish content, having the option to select between \\u201cnot-for-profit\\u201d and \\u201cfor-profit\\u201d, depending on whether they want to receive royalties for the content they publish. The service will be based on a freemium business model, in which premium users will pay a flat rate rather than per item, in a similar way Spotify and Netflix have done for music and movies. Additionally, in the future we plan to create a community in which writers will be able to establish contact with artists and developers that will help them to enrich their e-books, which will in turn increase the value offered by the content that will be available via the platform.This master\\u2019s thesisis part of the Leaf Project, and it constitutes the business plan for the e-reading platform. The first part explains the different stages in the start-up process, as well as how to evaluate an innovative business idea. Then the business idea is described and the e-reading industry is analyzed to show how attractive this market is. An analysis of the risks that the company might face is performed, and different financial aspects required to operate the company are listed. The report finishes with the conclusions about the outcome of the thesis project as well as with suggestions for future work.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-52917\", \"number-of-pages\": \"64\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2011:268\", \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-12-20T15:10:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2011-12-20T15:10:12.048+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T19:03:11.060+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-52917\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 64.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:507859\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2011]]}, \"title\": \"The Leaf Project : E-Reading Platform Commercialization Plan\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Khalil\", \"given\": \"George\", \"localId\": \"u1r3mc7r\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The publishing industry currently faces a re-birth due to the rise of Information Technology (IT),which has created new production and distribution channels.

The Leaf Project aims to position itself in the publishing industry by creating a new business start-up exploiting this IT revolution.We divide the publishing industry into three different parts:<ul><li>Production is concerned about content creation and acquisition.</li><li>Distribution concerns delivering the content to consumers.</li><li>Access and presentation is about how the content is presented to consumers and how they can access this content.</li></ul>In The Leaf Project we are developing a new way to distribute publications, along with creating an end user interface to browse and access this content. The project is divided into four different masters theses. One is concerned with creating the distribution network, and another is concerned with creating the end user interface. This thesis provides a market analysis and proposes a business model. The fourth thesis will consolidate the complete project by developing a business plan.When looking into the three different parts of the publishing industry, this commercialization plan first benchmarks the proposed end user application and the distribution network by comparing them with currently marketed products. Following this the thesis will examine what is the best content that could be distributed through our network. The final part of this thesis will recommend a business model based on the outcomes of the first two parts of this thesis.This thesis project should be useful for the fourth thesis project that must create an appropriate business plan and this thesis should also help the technical developer by providing market analysis that can be used to guide technical decisions.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91045\", \"number-of-pages\": \"49\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"199\", \"keyword\": \"commercialization plan; e-book; publishing\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-07T08:40:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-06T16:11:55.106+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:31:55.968+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91045\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 49.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:536329\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1995]]}, \"title\": \"The mobitex network in the point of sale application\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Dabbous\", \"given\": \"Fouad\", \"localId\": \"u1ntuctv\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Ismailov\", \"given\": \"Yuri\", \"localId\": \"u1qe4n19\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The Purpose of the work is to provide a solution for interfacing the point-of-sale terminal (POST) with Mobitex radio modem (mobidem) on the mobile side and a solution for interfacing the authorization center host computer with the Mobitex area exchanges (MOX), at the fixed side.

After that the client simply waits until the object is printed, with all of the various steps being handled automatically.The uploaded file containing the 3D design is automatically converted into Gcode by using the software Skeinforge. Gocde is the language that the printer interprets. The printer itself is controlled by the ReplicatorG program. The ReplicatorG program transfers the Gcode commands to the printer to print the desired object.

In the beginning achieving wide area coverage was a great achievement \\u2013 enabling subscribers to call from wherever they were currently located and whenever they wanted. Additionally these systems supported mobility of subscribers, so that calls could continue even while a subscriber moved from one cell to another. Today mobility management is something everyone takes for granted. New functionality is continuously being developed for these networks. An important aspect of this evolution has been to enable new applications and technologies to be introduced while maintaining interoperability with the existing technologies.These mobile networks use new technologies and enable new applications, but they interconnect with existing networks that utilize earlier technologies, such as the existing fixed telephone network. These interconnections enable communication between subscribers connected via all of these networks. In today\\u2019s mobile networks there are a variety of technologies working side by side, for example 2G, GPRS, 3G, and so on. The earlier networks used circuit switching technology, but the trend in later networks was to transition exclusively to packet switching.One of the most important network entities is the mobile switch center (MSC). In the earlier circuit switched networks the MSC is the heart of the circuit switching network. The MSC is responsible for management, control, and communication to and from the mobile stations (MSs) in the area managed by the MSC. The MSC stores information about each of the MSs in one or more databases. In the subscriber\\u2019s home network the information about their subscription is stored in a home location register (HLR), while when this subscriber is in another network information is stored in a visitor location register (VLR). The MSC together with other elements of the core network handles mobility management, enabling both handover and roaming. A gateway MSC enables MSs to communicate with phones connected to the fixed network.The aim of this thesis is to analyze the traffic situation for Kulyab region in order to configure and install the MSC in Kulyab. For the time being there is no radio network controller (RNC) in Kulyab region, so the MSC in Kulyab will be configured to support 2G traffic.The configuration will be based on the expected mobile traffic load in the Kulyab region, thus the first steps in the process were to collect and analyze data about the existing traffic in this region that is currently served by a MSC located outside of this region. The configuration of the new MSC will be based on this analysis.After installing and configuring the new MSC some question need to be answered, namely:<ol><li>Can the MSC in Kulyab support all the base stations in Kulyab region? If not, how many base stations can it support?</li><li>To what extent does the addition of this new MSC improve the overall network in terms of increased reliability, capacity, and throughput?</li><li>How much will the capacity of the existing MSC, that is responsible for traffic outside Dushanbe, be increased due to the introduction of the new MSC?</li></ol>\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91095\", \"number-of-pages\": \"190\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2011:140\", \"keyword\": \"MSC; MSC server; MGW; BHCA traffic load; connect traffic load; 2G; mobile traffic; mobile network\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-08T09:45:00.000+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-07T15:06:55.326+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:30:41.236+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-91095\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 190.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:527840\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"Traffic Prioritization Subject to Cost\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Ekstrand\", \"given\": \"Magnus\", \"localId\": \"u11peqs3\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Hubaux\", \"given\": \"Jean-Pierre\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"EPFL, Laussanne, Switzerland\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Martin-Flatin\", \"given\": \"Jean-Philippe\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"EPFL, Laussanne, Switzerland\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Biro\", \"given\": \"Georges\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"SA Adventis Communications Engineering\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"In order to carry real-time traffic like video, IP networks -- especially intranets -- recently began to deal with different levels of priority for communication flows.

The wireless networks of today are limited in range or in bandwidth. In this thesis work DVB-T (Digital Video Broadcast - Terrestrial) has been studied in combination with GSM (Global System for Mobile communications), in order to evaluate how such a system can be used to provide a high bandwidth, long range, data link.\\nThe commonly used Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is known to perform very poorly with asymmetric and long delay links. Wireless links usually have bit errors, errors that corrupts packets, and often these bit errors come in bursts and thereby corrupting many packets. More than one lost packet will significantly degrade the TCP performance. In an asymmetric network the link with the smallest bandwidth will set the limit of throughput if any kind of data acknowledgments (Acks) are used. TCP is ACK driven and for large asymmetries the theoretical throughput will depend heavily on the packet-size and the bandwidth of the narrow link. The DVB-T/GSM system is both wireless and highly asymmetric, in raw bandwidth as well as in delay, which makes the use of standard TCP unworkable.\\nMany techniques has been studied in order to find a solution to how the transport protocol should be tuned to handle the characteristics of DVB-T and GSM. The solution presented in this work does not set any demands on the host on the Internet, and is fully compatible with existing standards.

With Software Defined Networking (SDN), a central controller can configure these virtual switches. Virtual switches execute on commodity operating systems. Open vSwitch is an open source project that is widely used in production cloud environments. If an adversary gains access with full privileges to the operating system hosting the virtual switch, then Open vSwitch becomes vulnerable to a variety of different attacks that could compromise the whole network.The purpose of this thesis project is to improve the security of Open vSwitch implementations in order to ensure that only authenticated switches and controllers can communicate with each other, while maintaining code integrity and confidentiality of keys and certificates. The thesis project proposes a design and shows an implementation that leverages Intel\\u00ae Safe Guard Extensions (SGX) technology. A new library, TLSonSGX, is implemented. This library replaces the use of the OpenSSL library in Open vSwitch. In addition to implementing standard Transport Level Security (TLS) connectivity, TLSonSGX confines TLS communication in the protected memory enclave and hence protects TLS sensitive components necessary to provide confidentiality and integrity, such as private keys and negotiated symmetric keys. Moreover, TLSonSGX introduces new, secure, and automatic means to generate keys and obtain signed certificates from a central Certificate Authority that validates using Linux Integrity Measurements Architecture (IMA) that the Open vSwitch binaries have not been tampered with before issuing a signed certificate. The generated keys and obtained certificates are stored in the memory enclave and hence never exposed as plaintext outside the enclave. This new mechanism is a replacement for the existing manual and unsecure procedures (as described in Open vSwitch project).A security analysis of the system is provided as well as an examination of performance impact of the use of a trusted execution environment. Results show that generating keys and certificates using TLSonSGX takes less than 0.5 seconds while adding 30% latency overhead for the first packet in a flow compared to using OpenSSL when both are executed on Intel\\u00ae CoreTM i7-6600U processor clocked at 2.6 GHz. These results show that TLSonSGX can enhance Open vSwitch security and reduce its TLS configuration overhead.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-218070\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiv,64\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2017:195\", \"keyword\": \"Open vSwitch; SDN; Trusted Execution Environment; SGX; Cloud Computing; Open vSwitch; SDN; mjukvarudefinierade n\\u00e4tverk; SGX; molntj\\u00e4nster\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-12-10T14:43:55.947+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-11-22T15:04:33.835+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T23:17:41.146+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-218070\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 78.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1615039\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2021]]}, \"title\": \"Tuning the Canvas Docker Ecosystem : Tuning and optimization suggestions\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Wu\", \"given\": \"Nan\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"879223\", \"name\": \"KTH, Skolan f\\u00f6r elektroteknik och datavetenskap (EECS)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": []}], \"abstract\": \"Canvas is a LMS used by many colleges, universities, and K-12 schools.

However, small flight computers must have sufficientenvironmental knowledge and computational capabilities to provide real-timecontrol to function without a ground station connection. Using a Raspberry Pi4 model B, this thesis presents a practical implementation for evaluating pathplanning generators in the context of following a moving target. The practicalmodel integrates two waypoint generators for the path planning scenario: A*and 3D Vector Field Histogram* (3DVFH*). The performances of the pathplanning algorithms are evaluated in terms of the required processing time,distance from the target, and memory consumption. The simulations are runin two types of environments. One is modelled by hand with a target walkinga scripted path. The other is procedurally generated with a random walker.The study shows that 3DVFH* produces paths that follow the moving targetmore closely when the actor follows the scripted path. With a random walker,A* consistently achieves the shortest distance. Furthermore, the practicalimplementation shows that the A* algorithm\\u2019s persistent approach to detectand track objects has a prohibitive memory requirement that the Raspberry Pi4 with a 2GBRAMcannot handle. Looking at the impact of object density, the3DVFH* implementation shows no impact on distance to the moving target,but exhibits lower execution speeds at an altitude with fewer obstacles to detect.The A* implementation has a marked impact on execution speeds in the formof longer distances to the target at altitudes with dense obstacle detection.This research project also realized a communication link between thepath planning implementations and a Geographical Information System (GIS)application supported by the Carmenta Engine SDK to explore how locallystored geospatial information impact path planning scenarios.

These types of applications are referred to as massive IoT, as opposed to critical IoT, which emphasizes ultra-high reliability and availability and low latency. One type of network catering to massive IoT applications are Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs), and presently, many LPWAN standards are trying to assert their role in the IoT ecosystem.This thesis explores LPWANs from both technical and non-technical perspectives to ascertain their use-case versatility and influence on the future telecommunications\\u2019 landscape. With respect to spectrum, the studied LPWANs may be categorized as unlicensed LPWAN or licensed LPWAN. The prior category typically refers to proprietary solutions and in this thesis are represented by SigFox and LoRaWAN. The latter group includes EC-GSM-IoT, eMTC, and NB-IoT and can be considered synonymous with cellular LPWAN because they are designed to be integrated into existing cellular infrastructures.The results indicate that all of the different types of explored LPWANs support applications without strict downlink, payload size, and latency requirements. For use cases without these specific demands (typically sensors, meters, tracking, etc.), it is not a question of whether or not a network fulfills the requirements, but rather how flexible the requirements are. As a result the choice of network will be determined by non-technical aspects and a cost versus functionality trade-off where unlicensed LPWAN is typically cheaper. Hence, both categories of LPWANs offer a unique value proposition; therefore, they can be considered complementary. This notion is reinforced when looking at non-technical aspects such as ecosystem, regulation, network ownership and control, and network coordination, which differ quite significantly. Furthermore, unlicensed LPWANs are likely to be the vanguard of a new type of competitor offering the core service of connectivity.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-214941\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xvi,114\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2017:123\", \"keyword\": \"LPWA; LPWAN; IoT; massive IoT; NB-IoT; eMTC; EC-GSM-IoT; SigFox; LoRa; LoRaWAN; LoRa Alliance\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-10-13T09:17:16.962+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-09-25T21:37:43.999+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-27T00:06:56.327+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-214941\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 130.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:516952\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2000]]}, \"title\": \"Usability Evaluation of Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Nowbakht\", \"given\": \"Ali\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The present study is the result of a master's thesis project at Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm-Sweden.

However, we encountered some difficulties performing these experiments, which could be explained by the characteristics of the network (production network), used during the tests.\\nOur next step was to apply this theory to a high capacity network. The result of these experiments confirms that a reservation could statistically get through in the end-hosts and the routers. To our disappointment we found that loading the network with high capacity of flow results in failure to meet requirements of the reservation.\\nI believe that RSVP may be used \\\"as is\\\" for small and well-controlled environments.

The MUST is divided into five different phases that form a lifecycle, describing the workflow when conducting usability engineering: Know the User, Setting Goals, Prototyping, Testing and User Feedback.

There are two common wireless Internet access solutions: wireless local area network (WLAN) via hotspot, and high speed wide area cellular network via mobile broadband device such as 3G/4G Universal Serial Bus (USB) dongle. USB dongle was the pioneer product in 3G/4G market, and it is still a popular device in many countries. Mobile broadband can offer both high speed access and mobility. Technically mobile broadband allows Internet connection as long as your mobile transceiver can access your cellular network operator\\u2019s network. However, in practice the data rates experienced by a user via mobile broadband are not comparable to the data rates that are available via WLAN. Moreover, mobile broadband has been implemented according to multiple different standards. Hence, in order to provide a user with locally optimal service requires that user must make use of heterogeneous networks. Furthermore, the variety of networks gets increasing due to the emergence of various 4G networks.The aim of this thesis is to explore how heterogeneous networks could be exploited to provide a user of a laptop computer with locally optimal service, while hiding the complexity of this heterogeneous service. The research focuses on the implications of integrating multiple network interfaces into a single USB dongle. Our research shows that multi-mode USB dongle is still needed in market, though there are competitions from smartphones and mobile WiFi devices. We point out that the PPP (Point to Point Protocol) based USB dongle should update to Ethernet USB protocols such as RNDIS (Remote Network Driver Interface Specification) or USB CDC (Communications Device Class) protocols. Furthermore, we suggest a USB dongle should be able to work as a WLAN access point to share Internet with other mobile devices, and it should also work as a WLAN client which can join other hotspots. If hotspot operators can authenticate USB dongles by SIM cards, then users can easily access a great number of hotspots belong to these operators.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-169898\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xiv,57\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2015:144\", \"keyword\": \"Data communications; USB; WLAN; 3G; 4G; Datakommunication; USB; WLAN; 3G; 4G\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-06-25T15:41:39.641+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2015-06-24T13:20:44.586+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-23T13:31:57.138+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-169898\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 71.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:541143\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1997]]}, \"title\": \"User Centered Communicating Devices\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Falk Drugge\", \"given\": \"Anna Elisabet\", \"localId\": \"u1b6ah5l\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The extensive use of communicating computers in the future will require the development of products and services that are easy to use.

More and more communication techniques are based on packet-switched technology instead of the circuit-switched ones. At the same time as these technologies become available to the market new kind of services are evolving, e.g. wireless monitoring of vehicles.\\nServices like wireless monitoring of vehicles have been available on the market for more than a decade. Especially in Europe they are built upon circuit-switched technologies or message services with low transmission rates. Though with the upcoming packet-switched technologies the customers and service providers will get access to new types of capabilities regarding quality of service, billing, and transmission rates. To build these services new types of high availability service platforms are needed. There will be a strong requirement for scalability, fault tolerance, redundancy, and distribution. Additionally there\\u2019ll be a demand that the platform support hot upgrades, i.e. dynamic software upgrade during execution. These requirements are very common in telecommunications environments.\\nIn the report different wireless communication technologies are evaluated and the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is chosen as the means of communication. The reason is that it is a packet-switched technology, the transmission rate is rather high, it supports Internet Protocol (IP) data, and it\\u2019s the first step in the evolution path towards the third generation (3G) wireless communication systems. Services based on GPRS can also be used in the future 3G networks without modifications.\\nDifferent high availability platforms were also evaluated regarding the requirements placed on future service platforms. The conclusion is that more and more of these platforms will move from a hardware centric approach to a more software-based architecture. Of the platforms evaluated, the conclusion is that Ronja is the platform most suited for the task.\\nFuture services, e.g. wireless monitoring of vehicles, can benefit from using Ronja and GPRS. The time and money saved by using the high availability functionality provided by the Ronja platform are significant. To use GPRS as the communication media may also reduce the costs for the customers that use these kinds of services.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93288\", \"number-of-pages\": \"61\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-18T14:03:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-13T13:21:44.251+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:55:10.477+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93288\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 61.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:517624\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"Using GSM Short Message Service for Internet Applications\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Spens Clasons\", \"given\": \"Sam\", \"localId\": \"u10wm2io\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The purpose of this report is to show that the mobile Internet to some extent can be made to happen today by integrating existing GSM and Internet infrastructures while adding a little intelligence.

People find it convenient to be able to check for incoming emails without being required to be at a fixed location. High-end mobile phones with high resolution color screens and mail clients (or plug-ins) much like the classic clients that run on desktop and laptop computers, have made mail manipulation on a mobile phone both easy and interesting. However, one key difference is the phone\\u2019s battery power source. Where power was not an issue for desktop and even many laptop computers, since they are almost all the time connected to an AC supply or have high capacity battery storage, it is a major issue for mobile phones. While email applications have greatly advanced, there has not been much improvement in mobile battery capacity. In addition the battery lifetime has decreased due to the high power demands of multimedia applications, which may be running almost constantly.\\nTraditionally, a mail client checks for new email messages by polling the mail server. This works well with computers attached to the power mains or with a large capacity battery, but for mobile phones, polling causes significant battery drain. A solution would be to poll the server less frequently by increasing the polling interval, however this would delay email reception hence increasing latency.\\nIn this thesis we implement and evaluate a new mail delivery system without changing the underlying mail or communications infrastructure. The new system eliminates the need for polling by using network initiated mail delivery. This means that a mail server will forward mail directly to a particular user. Tests conducted with a prototype are compared to the use of the existing system in terms of power consumption and latency. These tests show that the new mail delivery system reduces both power consumption and delivery delay.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92016\", \"number-of-pages\": \"60\", \"collection-title\": \"Trita-ICT-COS\", \"collection-number\": \"COS/CCS 2007-11\", \"keyword\": \"Last Hop SMTP\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-26T11:07:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-03-23T16:23:18.243+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T05:14:25.533+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-92016\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 60.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:827016\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2015]]}, \"title\": \"Using Six Sigma Methodology to improve the performance of the Shipment Test\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Bin\", \"given\": \"Yang\", \"localId\": \"u10thvdi\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Rutkowska\", \"given\": \"Bogumila\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Competition and lead-time pressure motivates us to find new and better ways of continuously improving the output of our work.

One of the essential principles of shipment testing is to ensure that the test campaigns finish on time. Over the last several decades companies have spent large amounts of time and money on improving test quality and efficiency. Unfortunately, the results have not always been as good as expected. It seems that it is very difficult to improve shipment testing performance using traditional test management methods.Motorola introduced Six Sigma in 1986 and achieved 5.4 Sigma level which help them saved 2.2 Billion dollars during the first six years. From Statistic aspect, it means only 3.4 defects per million opportunities. The Six Sigma methodology has been applied as a management philosophy focused on improving efficiency and performance during the shipment test period.This thesis gives an introduction to the Six Sigma approach, including the concepts of Six Sigma, its history, development, and methodology.

This thesis describes how new services that only utilise spare capacity should be provided. Models and evaluations of the available capacity for packet switched mobile telephony networks such as GPRS and UMTS are presented. The capacity during daytime is limited and fluctuates considerably.\\nThe introduction of several quality of service levels is strongly advocated in order to protect sensitive applications and to provide cheap background service classes. In order to provide the background class with a low price the quality of service level has to be low in order to avoid disturbing the market potential for other service classes.\\nThe cheap background class would make room for new applications that require substantial transmission capacity but can accept long delays. These applications should not require user interaction. Examples of such applications are push services such as music, news and software distribution.\\nThe transmission costs for push services that only utilise spare capacity should be very low ideally independent of the amount of data sent. It is very important that the network operators have a flat-rate background class. To maximise the utilisation of the spare capacity it is very important to have substantial storage capacity in the mobile devices. Since the transmission cost should be flat-rated, the memory in the mobile devices will always be filled. A substantial increase in storage capacity will therefore allow new services to emerge.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93730\", \"number-of-pages\": \"65\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": \"GPRS; UMTS; quality of service; QoS; background services\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-20T14:18:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-24T16:26:41.329+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:46:58.092+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93730\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 65.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:515034\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2003]]}, \"title\": \"Value Added Services and Content Platforms\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Mahdavi\", \"given\": \"Adrian\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5995\", \"name\": \"KTH, Mikroelektronik och Informationsteknik, IMIT\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Pigall\", \"given\": \"Alexander\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Tele2 AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Value-Added Services and Content Platforms (VAS and Content platforms) was carried out with in a group with same name at Tele2 AB in Kista, Stockholm.

Acceptance testing is performed on new devices (servers and other network components) in order to verify their capacity and performance guaranteed by their manufactures. Every platform has a guaranteed upper bound performance (based on the license a buyer has paid for), measured by different approaches.

Since an SLA very often specifies a contract between a service provider and customer, I found it necessary to approach the QoS concept from an end-to-end perspective. Not only figuring out how QoS is meant to work in a separate LAN, but how you actually provide a verifiable level of service end-to-end across multiple networks. To be able to come up with viable solutions and ideas to solve this task I divided my work into several phases.\\nFirst I built up a working knowledge about IP networks, how they function and interact to form larger networks, secondly I needed to understand the vast QoS area, what technologies and standards are in place today and how they work together to form IP networks with support for differentiated traffic.\\nFinally I needed to understand how to monitor and supervise IP networks on both small and larger scales, to see what techniques and methods are used to provide network administrators with sufficient information about the traffic in the network.\\nThe first part of my thesis work provides information on these subjects giving a thorough understanding of all the different technologies.\\nThe second part describes different solutions to the problem of monitoring QoS enabled IP networks. The problem really has many sides to it. Not only did I need to find out what to monitor, I also needed to find out how to monitor it. Generally SLAs are pretty simple, containing parameters such as uptime, maximum packet loss allowed and so on. These parameters are relatively easy to monitor. A QoS SLA is by its very nature more complex, both regarding parameters to monitor and in terms of responsibility placed on the customer. Depending on the nature of the agreement between customer and ISP, a QoS SLA could fit on a single sheet of paper or maybe 10 sheets. It all depends on the level of service complexity needing to be specified.\\nIn view of the above and as a result of my work I have come up with a solution of how to monitor a DiffServ compliant network. This monitoring provides information suitable for the verification of SLAs. It enables monitoring of bandwidth, packet loss, delay and jitter for traffic.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93539\", \"number-of-pages\": \"98\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-06-20T11:01:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2012-04-20T12:35:25.601+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-24T04:50:23.477+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-93539\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 98.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:1129877\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2017]]}, \"title\": \"Video Integrity through Blockchain Technology\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Hemlin Billstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Adam\", \"localId\": \"u18m2arw\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Huss\", \"given\": \"Fabian\", \"localId\": \"u17k0dsc\", \"affiliation\": []}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"V\\u00e4stberg\", \"given\": \"Anders\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-4226-9652\", \"localId\": \"u1ft3a12\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"13053\", \"name\": \"KTH, Radio Systems Laboratory (RS Lab)\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Wilmot\", \"given\": \"Ben\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The increasing capabilities of today\\u2019s smartphones enables users to live stream video directly from their mobile device.

Blockchain is a technology with the inherent ability to store data in a chronological chained link of events: establishing an irrefutable database. Using cryptographic hashes together with blockchain: an Android device can generate cryptographic hashes of the data content from a video recording, and consequently transmit these hashes to a blockchain. The same video is deconstructed in the web client creating hashes that can subsequently be compared with the ones found in the blockchain.A resulting prototype system provides some of the desired functions. However, the prototype is limited in that it does not have the ability to sign the hashes produced. It has also been limited in that it does not employ HTTPS for communication, and the verification process needs to be optimized to make it usable for real applications.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-211532\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xv,77\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-ICT-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2017:122\", \"keyword\": \"Hashing; live stream; video integrity; video verification; blockchain; hash; direks\\u00e4ndning; videointegritet; videoverifiering; blockkedja\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-10-13T09:07:45.145+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2017-08-07T15:19:15.163+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-27T00:48:13.002+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-211532\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 92.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:516849\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2000]]}, \"title\": \"Virtual community networks\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Lind\", \"given\": \"Mikael\", \"localId\": \"u1g1ncx9\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Engman\", \"given\": \"Alexander\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Telia Research AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"As the use of broadband Internet connections increases a need for new services arises.

It is possible to enable full IPconnectivity in the cellular networks. However this connectivity is combined with a lot of issues such as security problems and the IPv4 address space being depleted. As a result of this many operators use Network Address Translation in their packet data networks, preventing users in different networks from being able to contact each other. Even if a transition to IPv6 takes place and the potential problem of address space is solved, it is not likely that operators will leave their packet data networks open to the Internet.\\nAn alternative to solving the problem on the IP level is to use overlay networks. In an overlay network applications on the cellular devices identify themselves at the application level rather than on the IP level. While full IP connectivity always gives the most efficient routing, an overlay network can offer services that are difficult to implement on the IP level. This can enable an application to <i><b>span Network Address Translating entities</b></i> without having to share the entire device. They can also provide private dynamic virtual networks and groups for users that trust each other. These <i><b>private networks</b></i> can use permissions and <i><b>group casting</b> </i>functions, without the problems associated with traditional IP multicast.\\nThe relatively limited bandwidths of the GSM and UMTS networks allow for application level routing of continuous data streams <i><b>if</b></i> the overlay network is <i><b>distributed</b></i> enough and mapped to the physical network in an efficient way. One of the advantages of using overlay networks is that although standard IP networks may be able to offer similar services in the future, overlay networks can be implemented in the existing IPv4 networks today at comparatively low costs. This may create the incentive needed in order for future larger investments to be justified.\\nA distributed overlay network not only allows for<i><b> real-time services</b></i> such as instant messaging, which is already possible with a centralized server solution, but it also allows for <i><b>higher bandwidth services</b></i> such as video conferencing, Voice over IP, etc. that are not possible on a large scale with a centralized relaying server.\\nAn overlay network could be implemented by any third party <i><b>without the support of an operator</b></i>. This suggests that free networks may be created for what could be called <i><b>reversed file sharing</b></i>, i.e. networks where users upload files to each other rather than download as in most existing file sharing networks. These could become direct <i><b>competitors to SMS, MMS</b></i> and other operator-owned services.\\nThe thesis investigates the mentioned possibilities and potential threats.

In this project, an automated detection system is used to detect sows in surveillance videos. This system is based upon deep learning and computer vision methods. In order to minimize disk storage and to meet the network requirements necessary to achieve the real-performance, tracking in compressed video streams is essential.The proposed system uses a Discriminative Correlation Filter (DCF) as a classifier to detect targets. The tracking model is updated by training the classifier with online learning methods. Compression technology encodes the video data, thus reducing both the bit rates at which video signals are transmitted and helping the video transmission better adapt to the limited network bandwidth. However, compression may reduce the image quality of the videos the precision of our tracking may decrease. Hence, we conducted a performance evaluation of existing visual tracking algorithms on video sequences with quality degradation due to various compression parameters (encoders, target bitrate, rate control model, and Group of Pictures (GOP) size). The ultimate goal of video compression is to realize a tracking system with equal performance, but requiring fewer network resources.The proposed tracking algorithm successfully tracks each sow in consecutive frames in most cases. The performance of our tracker was benchmarked against two state-of-art tracking algorithms: Siamese Fully-Convolutional (FC) and Efficient Convolution Operators (ECO). The performance evaluation result shows our proposed tracker has similar performance to both Siamese FC and ECO.In comparison with the original tracker, the proposed tracker achieved similar tracking performance, while requiring much less storage and generating a lower bitrate when the video was compressed with appropriate parameters. However, the system is far slower than needed for real-time tracking due to high computational complexity; therefore, more optimal methods to update the tracking model will be needed to achieve real-time tracking.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-240086\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xv,93\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2018:753\", \"keyword\": \"Computer vision; Video tracking; Machine learning; Discriminative correlation filter; Compressed video; Bandwidth balancing; Network traffic; Dator vision; Video sp\\u00e5rning; Maskininl\\u00e4rning; Diskriminerande korrelationsfilter; Komprimerad video; Bandbredd balansering; N\\u00e4tverkstrafik\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-12-11T13:42:14.442+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-12-11T12:57:36.221+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T18:09:11.644+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-240086\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 108.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:541153\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"Voice over IP - SIP client\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Filimonovic\", \"given\": \"Martin\", \"localId\": \"u17u9md7\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Lindberg\", \"given\": \"Niclas\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Ericsson Radio Systems\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"The interest in utilizing the Internet for real-time communication has grown substantially in recent years.

It plays a vital role to ensure national security and to control crimes by providing authorized monitoring of communicating parties in a communication network. However, there are some important issues that need to be addressed, such as the privacy of individuals, malicious use of lawful interception by a \\u201cbad\\u201d cop, vulnerability of a lawful interception system to misuse by others, cost, legal liability, etc. These issues have lead to opposition to lawful interception. Many researchers have been looking for a secure and acceptable lawful interception system that would eliminate or minimize the undesirable aspects of lawful interception. One of the approaches that gained a lot of attention is a key escrow encryption system. For lawful interception a key recovery key is escrowed with a trusted third party. This key can subsequently be used for decryption by the law enforcement agency. The trusted third party might be a government agency or a private company. The process for recovering keys should be based on a predefined securitypolicy. The trusted third party\\u2019s responsibility is to store the key and to protect it from malicious use. This malicious use\\u00a0could be by a competitor, a telecommunication operator, Internet Service Provider (ISP), a law enforcement agency, or other party. If the trusted third party itself utilizes the key or improperly discloses the key to another party, then the data that was protected by encryption could be compromised Unfortunately, there is no easy means to detect if the data has been tampered with or not. This thesis focuses on therefore in the case of voice over IP, where there is a need for a means to determine if a recorded conversation is authentic or not. Hence the objective of the overall thesis project is to design, implement, and evaluate a security mechanism that can be used with a trusted third party -based key escrow encryption system that will prevent or reduce the risk of forgery by (a bad cop within) a lawenforcement agency using the escrowed key.\\nThis thesis describes how a key escrow encryption system would be improved by the proposed mechanism \\u2013 with a focus on the actions of a party that has access to the escrowed key. We do not examine how the party got access to this key, but for the purposes of this thesis we assumed that this party is either a good cop or a bad cop. We have defined the meaning of these terms and examine what operations a bad cop might attempt to perform \\u2013 given the access to the master key. For example, this party could capture the data packets of a Voice over IP session, and then decrypt the packets using the key provided by the escrow agent. After decryption we examined the ability of a bad cop to modify or forge data packets, then encrypt these forged packets with the key \\u2013 in order to fabricate evidence. We then examined how to detect such modifications or forgery. The proposed system is able to detect this forgery, based upon the inability of the forger to generate the correctly signed hashed message authentication coded. We also examine additional extensions to the user agent and the escrow agent to be able to identify which packets (or groups of packets) were not generated by the original participant in the conversation. The goal is to understand if the proposed mechanism could make lawful interception more secure, while increasing the protection of the communicating parties\\u2019 conversation from undetected manipulation and making the digital record of a conversion easier to authenticate.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-24260\", \"number-of-pages\": \"164\", \"collection-title\": null, \"collection-number\": null, \"keyword\": null, \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2010-08-31T10:04:00.000+02:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2010-08-31T08:40:22.866+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-25T01:56:44.730+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-24260\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 164.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:511505\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[2008]]}, \"title\": \"Voice Over IP for Textphones : An implementation of an Analog Telephone Adapter enabling Baudot textphones to use real-time text over Real-time Transport Protocol using open-source code and hardware solutions\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"H\\u00f6rlin\", \"given\": \"Martin\", \"localId\": \"u10j35po\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Zetterstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Erik\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Omnitor AB\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Hellstr\\u00f6m\", \"given\": \"Gunnar\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Omnitor AB\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"In this thesis we will discuss how to implement a ToIP device that enables communication with a standard textphone over Internet Protocol using open software and hardware solutions.

To address security related issues Wi-Fi Alliance in conjunction with IEEE introduced an enhanced and interoperable security scheme called WiFi Protected Access (WPA).\\nReal time services are sensitive to latency, hence requiring bounded delay time throughout an ongoing session. Handovers in WiFi networks can take fairly long time which real time services cannot tolerate. The problem is further elevated when WiFi networks are secured by using WPA Enterprise.\\nIn this thesis we will examine the complete handoff process in WiFi networks.

In fact, software revenue is now a large part of the total revenue. As technology has developed and traffic demands increase, more and more functions required to implement the radio system are implemented via software rather than hardware. Today, many hardware functions are actually implemented with reconfigurable and programmable hardware. Therefore, it is often possible to perform an upgrade by loading new software (a software upgrade) rather than needing to change the physical hardware with every technology advance. However, introducing new elements and features in existing (often mature) software may cause unexpected problems. These problems may include new parts malfunctioning and failure or degradation of old functions. To avoid these problems, each version of software has to be thoroughly tested, not only to test the new parts, but also to verify that the old functions still work properly. Testing all the old functions is time and human resource consuming. Thus, there is an increasing demand for automated testing.

Moreover, the available bandwidth turned out to be an important factor, which should be added as an additional stats-parameter to improve the performance of a WebRTC quality control service.\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-232704\", \"number-of-pages\": \"xii,74\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2018:465\", \"keyword\": \"WebRTC communication system; QoS assessment; Quality control; Data Analysis; Modeling; WebRTC-kommunikationssystem; QoS-bed\\u00f6mning; Kvalitetskontroll; Dataanalys; Modellering\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-11-19T09:16:45.192+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2018-07-30T16:10:42.855+02:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-26T19:58:44.656+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-232704\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 86.0}, {\"id\": \"diva2:527039\", \"type\": \"thesis\", \"genre\": \"Dissertation\", \"issued\": {\"date-parts\": [[1999]]}, \"title\": \"Wireless Adaptation of a Security Management Protocol Suite\", \"language\": \"eng\", \"author\": [{\"family\": \"Carrara\", \"given\": \"Elisabetta\", \"localId\": \"u167oevx\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"6225\", \"name\": \"KTH, Teleinformatik\"}]}], \"supervisor\": [{\"family\": \"Maguire Jr.\", \"given\": \"Gerald Q.\", \"ORCID\": \"0000-0002-6066-746X\", \"localId\": \"u1d13i2c\", \"affiliation\": [{\"id\": \"5998\", \"name\": \"KTH, Kommunikationssystem, CoS\"}]}, {\"family\": \"Davoli\", \"given\": \"Franco\", \"affiliation\": [{\"name\": \"Universit\\u00e0 degli studi di Genova, Dipartimento di Informatica, Sistemistica e Telematica\"}]}], \"abstract\": \"Internet Security is rapidly increasing in importance, as Internet itself is spreading out so fast.

A general overview of cryptography is also provided, since ISAKMP widely uses modern cryptographic techniques.\\nISAKMP flexibility is at the cost of complexity and increased packet traffic. This should be faced in constrained communications, such as wireless. Therefore, this thesis introduces some proposals for a compressed version of the protocol, trying to reduce the number of handshakes and the number of transmitted bytes without significantly decreasing the security level.\\nThe model is based on the use of a Proxy, which follows the compressed version of ISAKMP on the side of the\\u00a0 mobile node, and then switches to the original version of the protocol on the wired side with the second peer.

It also shows how applications are created and how they operate in different parts of the network. The report covers security issues and services charging, as well as how other technologies could be used together with the Wireless Application Protocol, or how they could replace parts of it. The second part of the report covers the application I have created as part of my project. The application is divided up in order to show different aspects of the Wireless Application Protocol. The emphasis in the project has been on real-time graphic generation, which is exemplified in a vector based map application. The possibilities to connect Wireless Application Protocol applications to databases and peripherals are then explored.\\nIn conclusion, the fundamental idea of using the Internet as part of the network structure is appealing, both for users and services providers. There are, however, parts of the Wireless Application Protocol that are not realised in the best possible way. There are security weaknesses due to protocol conversions in the middle of the network.

Verification is done at runtime against a reference program execution trace produced by the transpiler by means of symbolic execution in the operational semantics of \\u03bcSPL. An observational study was made to evaluate the solution and the soundness of the \\u03bcSPL semantics. From the results of the observational evaluation, we find that the chosen method for translation verification is contextually suitable, albeit with potential for improvement in the details of the implementation.\\u00a0\", \"NBN\": \"urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-307621\", \"number-of-pages\": \"73\", \"collection-title\": \"TRITA-EECS-EX\", \"collection-number\": \"2021:872\", \"keyword\": \"Cockpit Display System; Compiler Correctness; Compiler; Transpiler; Computer Graphics; Cockpitpresentationssystem; Kompilatorkorrekthet; Kompilator; Transpilator; Datorgrafik\", \"published\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-02-03T10:47:41.833+01:00\"}], \"created\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-02-02T09:06:49.991+01:00\"}], \"updated\": [{\"raw\": \"2022-06-25T09:20:44.271+02:00\"}], \"URL\": \"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-307621\", \"note\": null, \"publisher-place\": null, \"publisher\": null, \"total_pages\": 73.0}]}}, {\"actions\": false, \"mode\": \"vega-lite\"});\n</script>","text/plain":"alt.Chart(...)"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":7},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a style='text-decoration:none;line-height:16px;display:flex;color:#5B5B62;padding:10px;justify-content:end;' href='https://deepnote.com?utm_source=created-in-deepnote-cell&projectId=7ff901d2-2523-45e6-ad7c-a0ffb7dec8be' target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt='Created in deepnote.com' style='display:inline;max-height:16px;margin:0px;margin-right:7.5px;' src='data:image/svg+xml;base64,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' > </img>\nCreated in <span style='font-weight:600;margin-left:4px;'>Deepnote</span></a>","metadata":{"tags":[],"created_in_deepnote_cell":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0,"metadata":{"deepnote":{},"orig_nbformat":2,"deepnote_notebook_id":"411e25448cc142cc8e375a740c679938","deepnote_persisted_session":{"createdAt":"2022-09-12T12:47:45.209Z"},"deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
